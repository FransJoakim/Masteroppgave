------------------------ Ch1. The spatiality of learning - on circulation, co-ordination and imaginations of mobility -----------------------------

This chapter is about the 'meaning' (agency) of the computer-network in the context of the classroom. I was trying to observe the circulation of content from the publisher to the collector, and the influence of the communication system. One could say that this idea worked as a provocation. 

There were many more uses of the computer and the computer-network. Throughout this chapter I want to establish some of the core concepts of access 

The computer is shown to work by merit of its fluidity and its legitimate position within fluid class-room spaces. In fact, paying attention to such fluidity makes me question the normality of the lecture - an knowledge unit/object surrounded by controvercy. The routines that does exist are very much dependent upon the flows of people - my position in relation to them. As such I don't take any cathegory of the adult position for granted. I link it to the idea of design - of active engagement with the roles of human and non-human materialities. This idea is composed of elements of power - agency - described by SÃ¸rensen. Different people had different ability to design a leason. 

Not all computer-networks were fluid either. They took different forms as part of different class-room spaces. In the science room..

If the government thought that they were testing these products out in a neutral space they would be underestimating their own dependence upon the mobile. Think just of the importance of the locker. On the other hand, if they thought the computer to be more suitable for the kind of 'objective knowledge' that could make up science competence, like Lee predicted, then they are underestimating the fluidity of the computer. Perhaps even mixing fluidity up with mobility, as a stationary computer could be highly fluid (think only of servers and virtual machines). 



why are spatial analysis important, and how do they relate to complexity, ANT and expert cultures?
>The benifits and posibility of multicited ethnography; imaginations of scale.







--------------------------------- Ch.2: virtual governance: constructing 'regional' policy --------------------------------



Here I have thought of 'regional' policy as a metaphorical form, that co-produces relational-patterns at different levels and cites. By the end of this chapter the idea of the region should be adequately problematized to be able to discuss separations between science and politics within the direct and in-direct forms of educational governance that I discuss. 
> I have expressed this through an model of alignment which establishes 'understanding by design' as a principle of 'good pedagogy'. Alignment is about attachments between authors and authority, like the validity of 'learning designs'; according to governance systems.

In this chapter focuses on accounting practices, and the importance of 'knowing what the teacher does' (the regional distribution of roles; pedagogy, administration..) in investigations into the politics of design for work and use. How do I come to terms with the idea of anthropological sensitivity in the teacher's practice? 
- (summary1;aug-sep) The idea of alignment with authorship sensitises us to the idea of forms of 'interestment of the digital' (interesting i.e. teachers). "How does it value the 'PLE as a computer based system' through the process of individualization?"


I write about the changing meaning of being a 'school-owner', and especially in relation to the 'becoming' of dataprocessing-accountability. 
- I write about openness as a form of accountability, and as played out among the rights and responsibilities of the pupil-students in the classroom.
> something controlled through the management of teacher services. Something that is liable to human bodies (illness or revolt).
 



(summary1;aug-sep) I wanted to study the influence of market devices and science on the **imaginations of affordence**. In the same way that the affordance article discuss how research performs understandings of performance, how are these strategies transfered into the management strategies that was part of the organizational setting? Or how code accompany new educational technology as genres of 'text'.

- The region used to be framed within the context of nations. I observe how subjective topical accounts of learning (evaluations) are co-produced with local imaginations of democratic creativity.
- I observe the weakness of the state, and local associations with the communities of interested responsibles. Perhaps is it logical that private schools care more for the individual? 




-------------------------------- Ch.3: the 'search' for local validity: the weakness of expert cultures ---------------------------------------

Boundary institutions: separating politics and science
> establishing an experimental culture

- The politics of 'meta' discourse (and data): the local is constructed through care for meta-data. Such systemic language omits the regional politics by adressing hybrid communities of experts and lay-men.
- It is part of production and performance of evaluation: the meaning of equity, and the regulation of networks.
