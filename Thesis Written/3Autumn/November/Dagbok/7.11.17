Having just 'read' **On organizing algorithms**
 
How are algorithms cared for in the classroom? This question borrows from the 'health by algorithms' presentation, but also investigates the particularities of education as a space of engagement with the translation of the abstractional power of algorithms. 

Studying the power of abstraction means being attentive to the dynamic calculative capacities of the digital algorithm. 
>The wires of the network: the infrastructure that makes up the calculative apparatus. 

It focuses on the abstractions that form the basis of 'progressive' learning modelling. It also means reversing the idea of a theory of legitimate knowledge, seeing that each subject uses its own apparatus of educational materials (constalations within the materialities of learning). 

The classroom has the double-nature of the virtual, in the sense that it constructs both a frame for the subject and an architecture for group trajectories through the spaces of the school building. The relationship between the two changes. 

This is why the conversation with Yannis was concerned with the question whether the 'personal' relationships among teachers-students should be seen as either:
-a preperation for LA, and largely unnecessary by today's standards
-or, as a transformation of the relationship based in the organization of the 'personal' and the alocation of experiences of shared presence and sympathy. The latter is a question of the bi-products of the organization of the learning experience. 

The idea that goal oriented learning is a product of the digital educational governance regime has consequenses for the way we study the translation of these goals into the routines of the 'subject-space' (a temporal distinction).

Yannis said that we have to study the translation of non-behavioral measures into behavioral indicators. The teacher performs this work as s/he transforms understanding, motivation etc. (the meaning of certain behaviors) into other indicators for use in the accounting of the work.

So I have two choices. To follow one of the routines as it is translated from the subject-space into i.e. the 'personal' spaces of the digital and non-digital PLE, or to generalize upon the materialities of the different subject-spaces as abstractions upon the temporal infrastructures of the classrooms as part of a school > i.e. one did not have the time to study the 3D models in the science room. 

This view in itself produce some cool effects; like resulting in a view of the medium of the textbook as fundamental to science, and vice versa treating (as I assumed on arriving at Bergness) also language (text), history, sports and ethics as sciences.
- through perhaps hierarchically ordered.

The first chapter therefore contrasts these encounters with the textbook (in digital and non-digital form) with that of the computer. The computer emerged slowly as an object of its own. It was not at once logical what the computer did. I was envisioning a study of distributed work/cognition, yet I saw 'individual work' and 'conversations with individuals' being largely performed seperately.

This idea of separation became central to my understanding of the design of these spaces. The spatial/social aspect of the media as mediating was more important than first recognized. Separation was indeed inherent in the design of computers. It achieve goal oriented work as based in the histories of ecosystems.
> i.e. the histories of drawing on paper, onenote on the computer, pictures in private, and ambitions as conversation. 
*one draws as part of the work of describing/mapping/planning, not documenting.

The sense of history continued, but it was a-synchronious. 

The same principle applied to movies. The class was mediated through a history of moving pictures, and in the 'quiet' presence of the spectators one could move around and fetch individuals, in groups or turn inwards. The 'spectacle' of the movie created a temporal alliance independent of the teacher, instilling meaning in the story that was that many minutes long.  So, while the movie controls the position of the subject it does not controll their identities. 

The computer's many screens has the capacity to divide the group up and show the spectacle on the same temporal format (like the idealized LMS), but it rearly did by itself. Either it was either accompanied by the teacher, or by other instruments of projection. The media became interactive, or intersubjective, by virtue of the ability to perform computerizations.
>re-scribing the order of the format; or re-distributing a relational pattern 

 
Chapter two develops the topic of the relationship to the office and bureaucracy.
