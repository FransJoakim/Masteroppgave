Reading: The (Im)Materiality of Educational Space 
The ethnomethodology is an spatio-temporal approach to inter-subjective associations with the cloud. How does performances of cloudification, as contexts of accountability, produce different spatio-temporal configurations (imaginations)?

Burnett (p.223) says that: "there is a need for exploratory research which captures how space is produced and what happens as different dimensions of educational space intersect. If spaces are continually produced and there is permeability between them, new kinds of educational space may be emerging in certain contexts, and for certain teachers and learners. There is a need, therefore, for more empirical work to understand different ways in which material, connected and textual dimensions are, and could be, intersecting in educational contexts, and to further investigate the link between space, identity, practice and power. Such work may not only highlight barriers to using networked technologies, but help describe spaces that offer alternative opportunities. Three foci are suggested for such work:
• analysing the processes through which space is produced, and consequently how certain identities and power relationships are upheld;
• describing the kinds of spaces produced and identities and power relationships they support;
• articulating the complex influences that shape such spaces." 

My focus is with the process of spatial *co*-production. I am interested in how presence is co-ordinated, and how this allows for conditions of accountability. 

My description of the 'kinds' of spaces produced I have simply been interested in 'subject-spaces', pertaining to different codes of legitimacy. Yet, thinking about it makes me relice that moreover I am interested also in spaces associated with evaluation - the production of individual space.

Relating to 'empiri' the teacher has to relate to her/his own body, and the perception allowed within the architecture of the learning design. 
The teacher could also allow for flow, by accepting separtation and allowing closer ties between the pupil-student and the media. 
The teacher then lets go of the idea of individual behavior. 


What did this have to do with my previous idea about productions levels?
I sayd that the teacher produce evaluations. These are produced within the different kinds of spaces on a cyclical basis, performing the legal and organizational responsibilities of the institution. However, they are also progressive, in that they (re-)produces society through the meaningmaking of the evaluatory schema. 
So in this cyclical progression, the secondary school continuesly producess the end of primary school and the beginning of VGS, while also establishing its own position. How does it create such a position, only within a three year period?

Materials are provided for free, and recycled in periods of 10 years. The operation is so large that standardization of pedagoic science has become very relient on the judgement of such books. This is described as 'textual mindsett'.



Last saturday I was thinking about what was important about the study of action. I was thinking that it was important because in kinds of expert cultures who's knowledge objects was characterized by a interest with the body-multiple action as a basis of personal experience had been notoriously ignored. If the same kind of epistemic system was part of the behavioralist/cognitive models of the 'learning design' discource of normative curicullum politics then an ontological turn within the process of spatial production would ....

In the first chapter I was thinking I would write about the production of regional networks of professionals. The expert culture is formed locally because within it there is a balance between care for the group as they are known by the team (and beyond) and care for the Subject-subject relations associated with individual learners. The professionalism of teachers is seen through the 'becoming' of autonomous judgement about the openness of activities, and associations with the preserverence of a schedule. The question becomes how personal space is produced and maintained, and how it is framed as an issue of security. 

In the second chapter I cover the relationship with pedagogic-strategic text as different than subject-texts. How is a curriculum performed in a local database? How is the database constructed within new technologies?
