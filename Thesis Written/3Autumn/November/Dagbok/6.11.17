-How is openness constructed within the education system?
*Instead of asking how research is performed the idea of openness concerns itself with the way that data is exposed and framed (technically and politically) within particular kinds of issue-associations.

-How is care for interoperability cared for in the classroom?

-In the classroom the teacher is orchestrating learning designs which are fascilitated by several different technical standards.
-To a large degree work rests on the technical standards of the textbook..
-Studies (like Selwyn) dealing with the 'everyday' use of data in classrooms are still concerning itself with the representations of learning that are done in these media ('M'edia). 
-There is a lack of understanding for the 'process' of design involved in setting up 'tasks' > their 'active' framing. 

-Ecosystems are arenas for struggle, in which technology providors are trying to construct systems that lock users off 
>Constructing non-interoperability

Windows have not done much to adopt the space of education. It is very interesting to theorize (ask by end of ch.1) why they remain attractive. Their familiarity works as its own form of domain (de facto) standardization.
-One observation is that MLG worked as an example of non-use. It probably did not show up as an indicator of LMS, depending on the practice of measurement.  

In addition to dealing with the designs that are given in the ecosystem the teacher deals with interoperability by co-ordinating the different systems means for measurement.
>One thing is the ROS practice's attachment with the practice of checking the register.

How is this is related to the work of constructing evaluations and measures? Activities like logging on and off are not counted with (ignored).  
-The teacher's work is definitely effected by the onenote/laptop system as he/she could check the work. *How does this mediate opinions?
The onenote system is not always used either.
>i.e. when the group has been on a trip, or 'go out and approach something from a practical standpoint'.



Openness is constructed in an aliance between different actors in the education system. 
-legal exceptions are made
-the teachers draw on associations with society, that does not draw on referential knowledge or local democratic principles, but on actors within the realm of 'EdTech'. 
+ i.e. the Red Cross tried to make an intervention into this space.
+ also, Conexsus attribute student profiles with associations that fold back into referential knowledge in a different way 

There are domain standards which concerns themselves with establishing interoperability where non-interoperability exists. 
These for example work within the domain of the education sector, though these boundaries are blurry. 

The question of what domain standards must be adopted within the sector is an engineering problem that result from the struggle for interoperability elsewhere. This is what defines the advancement of the ICT sector among other sectors. 

The dream of perfect interoperability within the domain of education is a dream that co-evolved with the measurement paradim of the new public management regime. 

The idea that goal oriented learning is a product of the digital educational governance regime has consequenses for the way we study the adoption and negotiation of goals.

Yannis said that we have to study the translation of non-behavioral measures into behavioral indicators. The teacher performs this work as s/he transforms understanding, motivation etc. (the meaning of certain behaviors) into other indicators for use in the accounting of the work.

Our conversation was concerned with the question whether the 'personal' relationships among teachers-students should be seen as either:
-a preperation for LA, and largely unnecessary by today's standards
-or, as a transformation of the relationship based in the organization of the 'personal' and the alocation of experiences of shared presence and sympathy. The latter is a question of the bi-products of the organization of the learning experience. 

Both are valid interpretations, one looking forwards and the other backwards. Both are however products of enactments of scale, in which the teacher both strengthens their competence as autonomous professionals by evaluating the relationship between task and competence (micro and macro activities), and participates in different (regional) communities of practice through meetings (co-presence) on a more or less organized basis.



** the Internet is not just ‘not one place’ , but always different, because of the fact that there are always different machines. Yes, some of those are constructed as servers and others as personal computers (mainframes are also their own servers(?)). What characterizes each device is that they all got daemons, as my friend told me. They face each-other like cells. And the daemons are the faith of nearby objects. Together they create a timeline
