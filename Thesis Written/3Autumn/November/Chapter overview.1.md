*Technologies of scaling and the production of comptenence*

With the idea of competence I mean the production and sustainance of 'legitimate' relations. The ability to be accountable to those that one is responsible to.



(from notes 6.11.17)
Yannis said that we have to study the translation of non-behavioral measures into behavioral indicators. The teacher performs this work as s/he transforms understanding, motivation etc. (the meaning of certain behaviors) into other indicators for use in the accounting of the work.

*These non-behavioral measures had been removed in the 97' reform. It then assumed there to be a posibility of a perfect system of measurement of behaviors, through the implementation of work made visible. 

Our conversation was concerned with the question whether the 'personal' relationships among teachers-students should be seen as either:
-a preperation for LA, and largely unnecessary by today's standards
-or, as a transformation of the relationship based in the organization of the 'personal' and the alocation of experiences of shared presence and sympathy. The latter is a question of the bi-products of the organization of the learning experience. 

The enactments of scale: the teacher both strengthens their competence as 1) autonomous professionals by evaluating the relationship between task and competence (micro and macro activities), and 
2) participates in different (regional) communities of practice through meetings (co-presence) on a more or less organized basis.
