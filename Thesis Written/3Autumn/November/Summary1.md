-'Fagplatformene derimot (i motsettning til resten av økosystemet/infrastruktur) må kunne etableres på de enkelte institusjonene. Må balansere konkuranse og sammarbeid på en platform.' (dag 2 uninett)


Ch.1: 
-What does it mean to see the teacher-subject?
>This question is adressed with reference to the meaning of semantic data. I thought of semantics when listening to 'the future of sex' podcast. The guy who was being interviewed was talking about the way emotional recognition in AI will allow humans to have another kind of relationship with technology. I was thinking that in chapter three I could go so far as to come to the recognition of the impact that 'embodied data' - or what I call post-human approaches to emotion - is having on the experimental cultures of cognitive science. Yet, already early on in chapter 1 I begin to address the question of semantics by describing how pupil-students are associating with machines. Moreover, it is the teacher that are affected by the pupil-students' shifting associations with such school property. Wheather the machine could directly 'understand'/read the emotions of the pupil-student is not so relevant as the question of the effects of 'cognitive' computing in practice. The idea of semantics then comes to refer to the bodey of the pupil-student, and not the 'computer' or algorithms. This goes beyond the idea that the users of computers are refered back to themselves somehow. Rather they by definition (memory practice of computers as automated space) relate differently with the machines that account for their work. From a pragmatic perspective this has consequences on all actors associated with the classroom. It also shows that computers have effects appart from the processes of learning-management. 


-Personal data protection and the spaces of the classroom/coridor.
-The politics of monitoring: designing for learning-evaluation.
-Teacher-multiple: Producing evaluation is a condition for creditation/competition.
-the politics of 'placed resources'
-equity
-Produces a regional network for evaluation.
-changing relationship with the subjective-representation of the pupil-student as accounting for order in the classroom:
-relating differently to noize.

Empiri:
-The different/multiple roles of the teachers
-Arbeidsplanen, læringsmål og felles bestemmelser
-Separasjon mellom rom med bruk av teknologi (kontroll av rom)
-metaforisk tilknytting til forholdet mellom 'teqnique and creativitet' (instruction by design and individualization).
