This thesis asks how research is performed at a secondary school in Norway. It is a critical study of the spatial relations that have shaped our understanding about how knowledge 'out there' is manifested in here.


##Digitalization as the emergence of mobility
My area of interest has been the difference between new databases and older systems integrated into the practice of teaching. *A shift towards mobile eduaction*
My idea has been to look at the 'processing' that used to happen in the teachers living-room after work and the processes that some researchers within education technology now call the 'industrialization' of education. Herein we find the resource intensive work of planning, organizing and systematizing lessons adapted to standardized criteria. A centralized process *Mass-production: Lee* Ultimately the latter could lead to more 'specialized' forms of processing and more individualized learning, relatively independent of time and space.


*added 19.10.17*>The school space used to be under the care of the church. Now it is under the care of the UH-sector and educational standards are developing through political technologies (closely) related and resembling market technologies. The Universities are now centers that is meant to mediate the circulation of media(?) - think of how Uninett is responsible for the mediation of knowledge-objects, their life spans (circulation) and ownership. Yet, this governance model attaches few criteria to the 'external' networks that are meant to give this national framework meaning. Rather criteria are put on the schools. The universities are put to work grading the teacher establishments at their own 'level', but weakness is constructed into the regulation of measures at the local level.*


I have been wanting to ask how this changes learning. *Article about publishing sector*: asking how some forms or formats of learning are fronted, negotiated or neglected, in from the perspective of the sociology of economics (or political economy). *A post-foucauldian perspective*

This is also interesting because some argue that Utdanningsdirektoratet (UDIR) are co-coordinating these efforts way beyond their mandate and because the technological development it tries to grapple with is larger than itself.
*The institutionalization of digital governance*
*The geography of 'Automatic Environement'(?)* The concept of 'Boundaries' turns the question of the 'imagined mobile bodies' around. What are the boundaries that are being re-negotated, and that the 'mobility' of the device intervenes into? What is actually interesting about knowing about the 'intentions' of the imagined design?


In an earlier essay I wrote within innovation studies I looked at the development of the Education Technology (EdTech) sector and saw that one of the most important trends was the advancement of financial technology (FinTech) into the education sphere. Providers of Learning Management Platforms, like Fronter and it'slearning, are loosing costumers to accounting firms as these are opening up for the extended use of their registers. This reflects a wider trend, in which FinTech is spearheading what we could think of as the Blockchain revolution. Niches are developing within areas of use that depend less on registers, like simple but specialized games, but developers avoid the regulatory issues **with storing data.**

The question of databases, which has been central in digital studies, is here a very interesting one. It would be possible to say that the situation reflects a trend that is happening through the process of what I would argue is the coming of the IT industry as a leading sector for innovation. **a size or scope of study that I have not seen in any research on education**.

##Research as economizing: Constructing market devices in the public arena
Some authors say that 'gamification' will be the driver that will propel the IT industry towards the forefront of the innovation system. Gamification is seen as a wider phenomenon built on the same kind of premises of a calculative device. Gamification is the principle of using mechanisms, design and thinking from games or 'gaming' to make human processes more productive. Individuals must think that their actions somehow lead to future benefit, necessitating the registration of data about their 'doings' inherent in most digital technology. This process in which the line between virtual gaming (comprehensive framing) and betting (risk framing) is being blurred is a very interesting process in itself. 

I wonder whether I can ask questions about the participatory nature of what we now a days refer to as AI. By this I mean how these systems gather data on premises (like open maps) in which use motivates users/participants to add and adjust information. The question of (information) location is of course essential because of the virtual nature of such technology, and I am interested to find out how (fragile) systems are maintained in fluid information landscapes. What I am interested in is probably the early infrastructure within Web 3.0 - the disruption of established markets through the creation of specialized marked devices and mobile calculative devices. I look at this as essentially the same question as that which I pose in regards to learning because again here I want to study the process of the construction of marked devices in contemporary society.

**I look at spaces of public/front stage and private/back stage in the school.**

I think we need to think of gamification as a product of the 'new ontology' of the digital, pointed to by researchers of the digital in STS, like *Ruppert et al. (2013)*. We could think of it as a form of abstraction, in which the new data pay for 'digital labor' or survailance alliances.

Gamification is (perhaps) thought to increase motivation in the individual. But what forms of agecement strengthen its agency?
**How does the public/private status of the data at various times affect these motivations?**
It should be seen in equivalence with the (mobile)'individualization' of learning mentioned above.

I asked how gamification is coproduced/comodified within the school system (grunnskolen). My idea was that gamification is about more than making activities fun (play). I think that gamification could be thought of as a kind of marked device produced to adjust to the flow of information in and out of the education system.






##Decentralization
The question is tied up with the valuation literature, and to be more specific that accounting.
I derived at the idea of the wearable computer by asking myself how I could understand these interactions through the lense of data driven enterprises, which brought me back to questions of how supermarkets can analyse the behavior of customers by linking their identity to certain mandatory passages.


Nye medier er i økende grad interaktive, BUT spørsmålet kan også tenkes på i form av prosesseringen som instiller læreren som observatør i et nettverk som sirkulerer læringsmateriell. Nettverket kan sies å desentraliseres. Igjennom bruken av materielle resurser hvor den kalkulerende praksissen, som tidligere tok sted hjemme i lærerens stue, i økende grad er en pågående prosess mellom lærer-elev, grupper av lærere, lærer-gruppe og elev-elev.

Jeg ønsker å studere skapelsen av infrastrukturene som medierer disse prosessene, og objektene som oppstår i de resulterende kontroversene. Videre spør jeg derfor hvordan forhandlingene av disse kontroversene vrenger infrastrukturene og gjør dem synlige.

Infrastructure inversion could this way be investigated through the study of data through a spatial analysis of data-creating devices. Studying 'data-driven enterprises' as actor-networks, or alliances of immobile devices, is comparable to the idea of studying the identities that are attached to computers, by studying the computers.

Hvordan åpner dette for handling? Og hvordan bygges alianser innen dette handlingsrommet?
Spesifikt spør jeg hvordan vitenskap og markedsteknologier brukes til å bygge slike alianser.





Sørensen's argument have in surprising ways affected research on educational STS (educational as being about the education system and its relationship to wider educational practices and tools). In Fenwick, Edwards and Sawchuk (2011) her argument is presented at the very beginning of the introduction. ANT is still presented as an 'extreme' approach to sociomateriality, as the idea that objects emerge through networks holds no space for wider cultural interpretations. In the preface the wider debate that this book introduces is however presented in relation to other familiar debates (like Knorr Cetina), and here the authors also present some of the limitations of the sociomaterial literature within education. These perspectives are said to have done more for the study of organizations and disperced collective action generally. It is exactly within this area that my analysis is intervening into. Not only am I looking at the organizational aspects of practice, culture, space and materiality/technology, I am looking at how technoscience is done through constellations of knowledge communities. More precisely I am looking at how organizational boundaries are done in the virtual and how these boundaries work on other knowledge objects. I try to take seriously the STS account of informatics and the digital, and trace the social production afforded by this technoscience into the science and technology of education. I divert from Fenwick's account on the basis that I do not trace these forms of knowledge into educational research, as much as I trace them into the school and its bureaucracy. This could also be described as the politics of technology and education, another strand of research...

What this perspective affords me is an account of STS that goes beyond 'ANT' in a sense (who discusses this?), because it looks at infrastructure and standards and not persons...
This difference is reflected in the idea that ANT looks at the micro-connections that create assembledges 'translation' (Fenwick, p.4).
