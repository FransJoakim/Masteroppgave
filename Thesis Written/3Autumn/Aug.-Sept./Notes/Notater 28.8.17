Ch.2
Previous chapter we learned that student politics was enacted as a local context - one in which democracy is now (literally) 'played out' as social situations in which anxieties is demonstrated through behaviorist methods.
*'(arbeidsm√•te)method is assumed to translate into a 'learning' experience, while anxieties becomes a topic of (assumed) 'social' abilities - performances not by teachers, but by students.

-I also experienced the limitations of this paradigm at an university level. I 'represented' a student voice, because continuous feedback on educational programs complicates relations of legitimacy (making the institution responsible instead of the teacher) - (double)abstractions of measurements.



Ch.3
-So what did I finally do with the temporal significence of the timing of my study - the end of the semester and the christmass ball. 
*An added weight on documents - professional seperation and 'playfullness'.

Showing that media co-produces the technical definitions it becomes very interesting to understand how 'deep learning' is translated into the context of my study. Seeing it as a technical adoption the idea that our minds could generalize upon paterns according to 'situatedness' fits well with the ideas of action theory, and the ANT/gotskian(*) framework. *Memory* is adopted as a tool and a technology, that works within 'dynamic' situations. Like an algorithm, or studies of pedagogies 'with' media, corelation with criteria is seen as an 'end-result' of clustered objects - a function. 
-In the front of Gamlem and Rogne's book about Deep learning in school we see a young boy facing the observer, but gazing somewhere beyond. He is actively focused, taking notes, presumably of content displayed behind the teacher-researcher (the subject of the observation). The colors and font are simple (orange, yellow and white) assuming the look of a technical magazine/folder(?). In the background hangs a typical classroom map. It clearly situates the boy and the picture in a classroom, but there is (at least) a double meaning as it also situates the classroom in the world (world making). Both the content of the map depicted (latin-america and africa at the bottom-left corner) and the ethnisity of the boy himself direct our attention away from Norway, and places the Norwegian classroom in an global context. Below the depicted (flat and stretched out) continents one find small pictures of topographical types (desert, snowy mountains, forrest, etc.) with the corolating topographical color code placed underneith. 
*The (semiotics) example shows the 'global' background and situatedness of the student. Like a map, he could access(gain overview), position(place/name) and assess(relate). According to my experience however the geographies of the landscapes are not thought. Typologies are attached to economic function, like rivers to transport water-ways, and mountain to blocades. These economic histories are however not positioned, but are given into a 'local context' of memorizable/accessible places. The ability to delve down (*deep*) into any 'area' and read/associate the context is clearly valued highly, but question whether (how much) these tasks actually are performed isn't. 
**Before tests assured that 'enough'(*) was done to *know* what was demanded, but when the '*method* of teaching' has become detached the idea of repitition (knowing as remembring) has also lost value. It is not lost, but since valuation practices are performed in material constalations it takes effect off the networks that regulate pedagogies and education-technologies.
