'Imagining the science of learning: translating education into the cloud'
-Now science emerges that investigates and intervenes into 'learning' at whole new levels. 
-Facts that shape the 'professionalization of the teacher role' is evident in the literature-material I found in the team-rooms.



NO! Try this instead:
'Imagining intelligence: caring for pedagogies in decentralized learning design'

Observing cognition as it is imagined, as tools for intelligence, means seeing it in the processes that are a

##Computerizing the cognitive
-What does it mean to computer? 
-What functions can a computer perform and how so?
-How is computers performed? How do one re-produce the person-machine relationship?

God! That's what I'm doing! I am: 
RE-PRODUCING the person-machine relationship.
How is it co-produced among teachers, within their imaginations of intelligence?

Computerizing cognition MUST (according to STS) be seen as interventions that presumes new distributions of cognitive work.
Previous literature acts as if the re-distribution of these roles isn't a continuous process. 
By investigating 'mobility' I am therefore also studying the institutionalization of such processes 
- what makes moblity possible is the autonomous judgement of teachers.
- This is described well by the article about measurment, and the continuous re-negotiation of 'meaning'.

Decentralization is paramount, because my investigation adopts Suchmann's study in a critical fashion. It asks what changes (in terms of its scope) as one moves the site of investigation. A mass-production of methodogogy.
-What I became so exited ago when theorizing the professionalization of the teacher role was thinking about how the ethnographic method was being adapted to their requirements. Like in the STS study of accounting and the study of the group interview mediator, the method/techniques in use is a product of simultaneous considerations between pragmatism and 'realism'. 

*What does it mean to cosider affordence in virtual space? How is the concept of 'affordence' adopted by school-personel encountering education technology in the cloud?

These are questions that become important as 'design-tools' are merged into the user interface of windows systems.
