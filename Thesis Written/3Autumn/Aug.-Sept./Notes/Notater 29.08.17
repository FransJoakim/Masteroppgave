Caring for learning analytics systems: imagining decentralized education design in Norway
Artificial Inteligence in Education Systems: caring for the ethnographies, pedagogies and politics of learning analytics in Norway 

*What does it mean that the LMS is an interface?
The LMS is described as tip of the ice berg in TedX video (Open learning analytics). Very few things are recorded here compared to elsewhere.

-Thinking of categorization systems the question of what is recorded where is central to the groups that *interact*
Their identities, politics, ontologies and actions depend upon these interactions/negotiations
*Therefore saying that it comes as an surpice that LMS functions acts as an administrative tool shows how misunderstood the principles of sociomateriality and 'mobility' are. The LMS only moved answers to the teacher, who are MANAGING.

**Thinking of Learning ANALYTICS systems focus on a different process, that of accounting for.
