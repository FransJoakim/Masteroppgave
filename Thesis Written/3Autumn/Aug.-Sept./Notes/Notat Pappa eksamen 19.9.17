Boundary infrastructures and Improved Assessment Practice in Norwegian compulsory education

Jeg sp√∏r hvordan skolens utviklingsarbeid er knyttet opp mot utbyggingen av digital infrastruktur. 
*How is infrastructures of mass-individualization governed, and how is it used as a political technology in the translation of the cloud technology and the Internet of Things?

This thesis is about learning analytics and its history. 
How different systems work with different assumptions about complexity.
How computers are accounted for in education, or how computerized learning is accounted for.

How is learning analytics performed? 
Instructions and their computerization
How education technology is engineered and how its design is cared for and implemented

How are educational goals engineered: educational management performed
How it integrates/assembles several technologies to perform educational goals

To say that educational goals are engineered means that it is a technical question performed, within a market and a range of interests
How are different educational technologies integrated (systemness) to achieve educational goals.

Are teachers an educational technology?
Educational goals include teachers.. changing the (whole) system.

One assume that it is possiple. 
The sociotechnical perspective on the integration of computer design (what is called cybernetics)

*How is the PLE infrastructuralized (in the IoT)?

It is about people that do technical things, and design for technical things, but that live in a world that is not simply technical.
Working together with teachers, they have different competences and world views. 
This is as much of the integration process (translation of ontologies)


I see 3 different aspects to the task ahead:
1. Nationalization of (computer) infrastructure: digitalization
2. How LMS perform as an experimental system
*The LMS has a history of being an 'open sourced' solution working inbetween systems. 
Like the internet its interestment is with system integration, but how does it perform in relation to concerns with freedom (recursive publics)?
-How experiments are performed and governed in an autonomous educational setting.
3. Separation between person and computer (in invisible categorization) in the educational system
-a relationship between the materialities of learning, the materialities of education, and the materialities of schooling.
-How is autonomy managed at all three levels, and why is it necessary for governance?
-How is agency monitored, and how is agecement performed?


The LMS is integrating several systems. Often an open source sollution, but in my case is it just Windows.
Is it like when Microsoft (including Apple *platform*) in which offers an ongoing, updated system. Experimenting on the background, whilst offering an ongoing 'program' (outcome based system)?
*updates* with everything




**Translation**
How different educational technologies are translated to achieve educational goals?
We are not just talking about education, but the education system (spaces and communities).

I ask it as a question of translation: what is the inside and the outside? (boundaries) *early research
In the imagined system, updates comes externally. However, it also happens within the administration, and teacher. 
Then you got all the different classrooms, groups (more or less granual) and individuals.


Experimental cultures and STS
-So far I haven't discussed the specifics of STS
*the experimental system and the importance of the user*
In the educational system there are serveral groups having influence on the system
Experimental engineering can be performed even though
Experiments are performed by groups other than the engineer, including sales, marketing, designers, etc.
In systems in which it is not clear what one can expect to be produced it is difficult to 'imagine' what happens in an organization. In the school system there are too many interests, and one cannot assume that anyone knows what it that is that is supposed to be produced. 

*How does one care for a frontstage and a backstage

It is strange that in a system as important as education it is strange that one does not have clear goals and directors and managers responsible for its development. There are off course directors and managers, but one does not usually ask oneself whether the school system works as a common (usual) organization. Trying to consider it as such, one has to think about that it is by far the largest organization in the country. And internationally it is furthermore the largest organization in the world.

Also one has to consider whether a director-manager will perform the best work - assuming that it would would be like assuming that communism and dictators are the best governers. That is why this is a social science question about management and not a question of management per se. 

Using specific words like 'accounting for' or 'caring for' has a specific purpose. These terms are used in a very literal sense, but they are also adopted from studies of veterenaries and nurces. These groups care for experimental animals, or experiments in hospitals. One would think that in hospitals and labs there are managers or scientists directing all the work, but looking what the nurse or the veteranary are doing one see that for example the experimental animal is as much part of these organizations as anyone. 

An experimental animal have to be taken care of to perform in an experiment. Not simply making sure it survives, but taking care of its well being. That is why we say that we interst them. One has to be sure that it is healthy, that it lives good lives, and one has to controll the engineer. One has to put ethical frameworks on the scientist or the one trying to have science produce something. If they are the ones controlling it it does not work, or has faults. Because it is not right to say that an organization works from the top-down. It is empirical wrong. If one goes there one sees that the manager is not there. Ergo it is not true. 

The school 'system' is an impossible mass. Therefore I have gone to a school and spent two weeks there writing down my observations. I have picked a fairly random selection of situations and I try to explain those. It would be impossible explain everything that goes on at all schools at all time. It would be as impossible as explaining anything else. *All knowledge is partial as Latour says.* Everything is just reductions pertaining to a few situations.

From a few situations you could make out typicallities, drawing a picture of a common situation. We could assume that the situation is nothing extraordinary, but looking around at the situation in schools today we could say that 'hey look, there is a computer in the classroom that runs a new windows system. Thinking of how that windows system is part controlled by one of the worlds biggest companies based in the US, inside another country, shaping the way they are reforming their education and political system, one is left with a very big question.

Clarifying how the system work, confronting (provoking) those working in the system with the complexity of the whole things.
I'm not trying to explain the complexity of the system, but I'm trying to highlight how they are working with the complexity of the system. 
If one ask a teacher about these question one can get several answers. He/she might say that those questions falls outside his/her area of responsibility and knowledge. Or, if one does a structured interview writing up specific questions more of how their routines are enmeshed in the complex workings of a system could become clear. Yet, one could go further and follow them around the organization and observe how they work with a whole lot of complexity. They might not even know.

-This is an organizational question
How the actuall organization is working to integrate *Cloud technology*..
Opening up the problem of how to follow actors around are complimeted by the empirical question of actors as assemblidges of technologies. 

How does data saved on a server somewhere changing the organization?

*It is an empirical question how the LMS has been working*
-They have had it for 10-15 years, and I try to be specific about the technology..
I try not to take a standpoint to whether it is working or not. I try to show that it is more complexity than most educational research is showing.

Most educational research is framed around the classroom. The experimental system that we are talking about is part of modern history. Although you think that these complex new technologies are posing unprecedented dangers, yet as books like 'The materialities of schooling' is showing it was a major project to develop pens at a large enough scale. Its mass-production was accompanied by new philosophies, an industrial complex, a system that was highly goal oriented and assembled millions of people. Educating the entire population has been one of the biggest projects in history. *industrial almost, like health*.

*The classification system and large infrastructure systems*
What is the foundation of this system? The class. 
I study the classroom, and what is interesting is the fact that classing is an act. 
Talking about the LMS it was imagined that one would create a high-tech information system, assembling information in an pre-organized form. The idea that information is something (like communication) misses the geneology of these ontologies. Information by definition seems to be already classed. It is data, about something. It is one side of a duality belonging to the realm of thought, and we overlook the grid etc..

The underlying assumption of alot of 'high-tech' devices is that it should be able to *figgure out* this order without you understanding it yourself. 

This is why my topic also discuss *artificial intelligence* as a continuation on the same theme. 

Being specific about technology also means trying to keep away from discussions about the potentials of future developments.
In the same way that it does not work to say that classing is part of the working of the classroom, one cannot expect it to make sense to gather a bunch of different information in one place. One simply has a bunch of information that does not make sense to anyone - no grid. 

Classification of things does not work one changes the classification system. That is why we talk about an experimental system. Scientists work to class things, but when things does not fit one has to change the paradigm. That is why one talks of evolution, as it points to the fact that no classification system will ever be perfect because there is an endless variance of things. 

Cultural systems are like any living sytem (studying social change historically) means studying complexity. 


*Managing Large information infrastructures*
So what do you do when you got a massive organization and infrastructure that works very slow, disperced and decentralized manner?
The value of decentralized networks, like LMS or intranet comes into focus.

Other technologies are enmeshed in networks that exist in paralell to these decentralized technologies, like the SMART-board. They are procured on a product by product basis and everyone could download the program that was associated with the technology on the SMART website.

On the other hand, I had to go through IT-supervisor Alex to get access to the Windows 365 system. The cloud is virtual, so I look at the way it its categorizations values differently. How does it value the PLE as a computer based system through the process of individualization? How does it interest in the digital?

Observing these infrastructures are both hard to observe and to know. They are often technical issues.

Rather I follow start in describing the relationship between the human and the computer

In the institution and the classroom they are trying to class the computer. When classing the computer they are also translating an ontology, and a working mindset of the way and organization and learning should be done. It also effects the pedagogy.

My conserns are with how to study the causality between pedagogy and the computer. What causes what is important for the management and translation process. This is similar to the way Polls studies ethics empirically as a matter of 'good' care or good nursing. But also the way Law studies the farmer does the controlling, and not the technologies of control alone.
*Emergence of desiese could be compared to learning. It is an emergence of associations with classification systems and practice that describe risk. 

How does one understand agency in the processes of decission making and implementation then? 
The translation process: it is a metaphor that emerged in linguistics. The epistemological minimalism derives from the premise that everything is in a sense a matter of translation. When something is put into a(nother) context there is a cultural and organizational adaption. 

The translation metaphor works in the matter of science, like education science, when one ask why some countries are imposing stricter controll on educational institutions while others are loosening. It is as if different cultures values the data differently, and equally the systems equally produces different results.

Now doing semiotic materialism translation moved out of linguistics and brought this extremely broad theory into the field of the material. The idea of bringing something into a 'different' context allows alows us reflect on the concept of familiarity, and think of the pshychology of seeing, familiar concepts like hats, faces and rooms, etc. 

Moving beyond the linguistic turn in social sciences one also tried to move beyond a focus on the human. Doing so resulted in what is often described as an extremely broad theory. 

Being critically engaged with the ANT framework and being methodologically minimalistic means using the ANT framework as a starting point, and not as a goal. It studies agency by studying the materialities of action, whether it is the processes of valuation or power of a different kind. On an organizational level values are important as they allow for the coordinaiton of action. 
Using a minimalistic methodology means rather than use ANT to demonstrate the complexity of the theory for its its own ends (which is quite normal) but to ask question something that takes a whole lot of complexity as its starting point. The fact that we can observe complex world fenomenons in the real world means that we can make conclutions without a great deal of theoretical rigidity. Rather we engage in a 'reflexive turn'. And even if a conclution might be relative modest their relevance are still not insignificent. The conclutions that are valuable from the point of view of being in school and looking for the systems that hold the world together. These answers might be limited in terms of validity, but one can ask questions that others might argue that could not be asked on the terms that the theoretical framework does not exist of yet, or one can explain something usulally pertaining to the explanatory framework a group of experts.

Although I deal with technical questions of systems and infrastructures technical investigations in themself depend on all factors being put forth from the beginning, so that an analysis might compare events on an equal and 'neutral' grounds. One tries to solve a problem by getting as far as possible from the point of framing a question. However, as I approached this study the question was not framed. The question was rather highly complex, as one tries to be specific about the study of emerging agencement in a complex world. Most of the work goes into framing the question, and making timid theoretical steps towards framing it in a logcal manner. 

The mass of material that make up the world of the school system is moving in directions that are not previously known. When new actors emerge we do try to measure their effect, although as Callon explains this for of measure might only be possible in a qualitative way. 

In this essay I therefore develop a diagram, based on Callons theory. Callon's two ... of translation is co-ordination and alignment. 
It is difficult to use because the translation of materials are emerging and therefore connected to everything else. In practice this means that it is hard to deliniate and distinguish. In practice the ethnographic study is concerned with making out a narrative with actors that represent aspects of what one observes. One always has to select a few elements for ones own translation of what one observe, meaning that STS scholars recognize their own intervention. 

Being clear about this intervention we have to ask how the actors in our story represents something in the interest that I had in the situation. My limited empiry was both the basis for my investigation, meaning that one also actively - reflexively - seek valid representations of what one sees among the communities one participate in. The flip-side to the story is therefore that in addition to representing what makes sense to me as an observer the narrative also represents what the actor is allowed to represent. It can be matter of people, of technical infrastructure etc. 

That was the point at which ANT went on to represent its own theoretical framework. The actors could represent absolutely everything, including non-humans. Callon wrote about clams and the interests of clams. The reason why Callon used the example of the clams was also the fact that it underscored the missunderstood nature of the complexity of the lives of clams. One wouldn't think much about the interests of clams. They are not usually 'interested' in any representation, meaning they are not interesting from the perspective of most. 

Callon went to the coast of France to study a meeting between scientists, fishermen and the representations of clams. In the meeting an aliance is discussed. The fishermen have been overfishing. The scientits seek their own recognition and sociotechnical system to be validated by their representations - they want to be a mandatory point of passage. The clams want somewhere to grow. 
 
Scientists tried to represent the interests of clams, but the clams weren't sure whether they wanted to be represented. In the process of translation actors could be anything. They could be people, things or even concepts, but the principle is that something represents something that is not there (the network). What had been brought from the clams was scientific data. The scientists didn't call it the representation of the interests of the clams. It was thought of as the science of clams. However they can't represnt all the clams in the world. They represent the small groups of the clams that they have (physically) met with and tried to interest in an experiment of some kind. 

The clams are however not interested in the way they are represented at the meeting, and when the scientists went back out they found out that the clams did an act of treason. They did not comply with their plans of growth. It was indeed framed as as a scientific question, but it was just as much a matter of the clams not being interested in the devices and systems that the scientists and fishermen put forth. Only after several rounds of experimentation did they found that the clams appeared to consider their opportunities of growth improved in the aliance with interventionist devices that they commited treason with their 'natural' environment. 

Obviously Callon does not know what the clams were 'thinking', but he represented them according to the principles of symetry. His starting point simply assumed as little as possible. In anthropology one can say that the development of language depends on 'new' concepts having a meaning. Cool words does not take hold without a sense of cultural significance. And equally, some cultures are in a sense forced to adapt words in for example english, as these words really better represent the world as it interests its actors.


Alignment is the process of representation and inscription. *So while Hull is looking at the way the lives of documents are effecting the act of representation in government, he is really investigating forms of political alignment as it is affected by the co-ordination of document formats - its power* This is what political science always tries to point out. Just that they make the reverse arguemnt. The argument is that everything is political, and everyone should be more interested in politics. If one stops thinking about the political system as something happening at the time of election, every four years, everything is worth asking questions about. All the time one is represented here and represented there, quite independent of eachother. Furthermore, one often make (more or less conscious) choices about where one chose to be represented and not. 
Unfortunately pol.sci. is having a difficult time being understood. Many studies in STS have worked to show how such a ontology could be understood, but for that reason it has also been critizised for being simply descriptive in nature. 


*In the education system*
In my study of alignment of the experimental system I pick out some actors and describe how what they represent. In the LMS several actors are represented. *This is a key function*. The LMS has the potential of representing a wide variety of actors. The promotional videos in itslearnings website therefore opened the question about why such variance often is minimalized, and only seemingly routine tasks are acted out in these systems. 

It also includes several systems, and the way it does this is the way it represents a learning management system in online (cloud) environments. 
In the LMS a managing system is represented, representing learning management at some level. What level is that? It assembles several subordinary components while having some that view and administer it. What sort of management does it represent, and here the form of experimentation becomes relevant. What interests does the administrer represent, and what direction does it try to move the organization? 
How is the system managed, and how what is the strenght with which these aliances are formed? 
If you cannot interest the other elements in the system, or the other systems (networks) on the same platform, you have a very limited function (agecement).

The LMS, like much of the 'technopedagogic' experimental culture, has always been biast towards the 'class' and the classroom. The system is partly really representing the managing of the class more than the class.. 



*The example of the system*
8B represents many different teacher. Say 10. As well as many different students. The boxes that appear are digitalized in a particular way. 
Eng.20058b does not mean the updating of the system, but it is making sure that the teacher is representing a particular group associated with a specific empiri. 
What complicates the picture is the pasing of the years. One cannot simply transfer the folders over into the next bulk as content is attached to the LMS boxes and not any central database. What are the consequences of such a decentralized system? 
So the 8th grade has its own infrastructure. These folders represents what is supposed to happen on the 8th grade. 

covering a topic is an organizational performance (achievement). 
These boxes exist in nowhere.. They are fixed.
So a whole other infrastructure is constructed as the same group moves to the next year. You think that 8B represents a group, but it represents an organization, structured towards a plan. Covering a topic each day, that week, or to a minimum that year. 
The regulations say that a corriculum has to be covered before the end of bulk years, like the end of secondary school - year 10. 
*So something is structuring the system towards the sceleton plan*

The materials made for that year etc. is made into infrastructure, meaning that while it stays permanent it is the people that move. 
*The arguement about the resulting illusion of progress has been pertinent in the californian cirtique.
The artificial movement becomes relatively clear, and no wonder the education system seems so rigged towards the comming of AI technology.
*I show that AI can be done in several ways*

Talking about AI arriving, one has to understand that this form intelligence is very much part of the modern system. Moving people through these catergorical spaces, measuring movement, but not really knowing what is learned on a deeper level - weather or not.

To know more about the learning one has to be critical towards the system: resulting in questions about what learning is (theory).

In my example an programer has been hired, who has a windows certificate. Windows is offering plug-ins, like an app. Windows app function has been controvercial! 
The problem was that the *layer*(?) was more complex than expected. People have had a very simplistic idea about the nature of the LMS. The LMS has had very simple tasks, and researchers ask why they are so poorely implemented. This was my starting point, but it soon became clear that it was more complexity to these systems - both in the technology and in the organization (not usually thought of as the same thing).

How difficult could it be to have a system that adapt to the fact that an user sometimes pick a role as an english teacher (working at a distance), and allow some functions like homework. When the system came into view there were many options, causing it to fail to interest the teacher. When you were about to pick a subject one was presented with a endless list of options. 

What the programmer had done was create a program that looked nice, attaching it to the lists from the seperate databases in the SMS/FinTech. Being able to gather and 'pull' from the cloud, meant that he pulled information down associated with information/lists from previous years (lists that in the classroom is changed continuously - like seating arrangements in a Deweyan sence??). 

What was the text actually saying? Allowing for search..
Not only lists of all the subjects - including non-mandatory subjects (perhaps 10), which had the variance of classes on groups and levels.
So what is the bulc. 8B represents something specific, more specific than an entire class. It links to a subject, to a year of birth, and the group. 

The same corriculum is not the same think as the 'told' story. There is also variance because of org. necesity for separtion, to allow the same class to repeat itself and use the same resources over again. 

One would think that the computer links these boxes with the techer, but the program links certain *accounts* with a calculative device. It seems fancy, as it gathers a few medias in an automated sense. Life becomes easy as everyone should know that which is automated (varified and undeniable). Each person gets it without having to go and look anywhere (a form of presence in the classroom). Two cathergoreis are linked, the teacher (relatively simple) and the class. 

*The idea that teacher qualifications are linked to these accounts is also very important, though here it is perhaps only verifiable over time (automated).*
Materials are also not standardized, as this system is thought to allow for flexibility. There is a behaviorist pedagogy inherent in a system that allows for access to be a matter of time and space alone *more chategories are added in the teaching crowd book*


*A moment in time*
The teacher doesn't know so much, They talked about it but it failed, people didn't get it. Someone was sick. The group isn't on point. They are talking about the exam next weak, or a fight that broke out, sickness. 

In practice the exam is domnating. In the 90s they tried this, but it has gone the other way. Why would you need teachers with training. The teachers are now gaining more agency to teach. Who should be responsible in the system. The expert has been the one with the education and comptence. 

Even taking the standardized corriculum as a starting point one cannot expect the entire country to cover a topic on thursday. A moment in time is not a natural phenomenon, it is constructed. It is based around what can fail (systemness). Modern time and synchronisity organization that produce effective results, automation and simplicity does not make something that is easy to construct. 

What is the politics of the teachers having the education to pick materials? *politics of design*
There are systems that make sure that students know the same thing, but the frames of a sure system would be reductive to making sure someone can complete something in two hours (infrastructure). Because one cannot assume that ones that knows the best are the ones constructing tests. The ones being there every day with the education could have a better point, but it does not answer questions about what could be known and not. 

They are trying to get away from the tyranies of the textbook.. Theories are not one, but the reality is different. 
I look at how it works. Even if they managed perfect synchronisity, they still have to go through the barrier of the teacher who has to adopt to the 15 minutes that he has to act as the 8th grade english teacher. 

The LMS doesn't automate the process.. Connecting lists of accounts produces houndreds, or thousends of classes. The time is constructed. All the kids born in those years have to deal with all these 'boxes', without anyone being aware of the boxes they deal with (a common critique by parrents). 
So the next year the entire system rewinds. 
 
*Making a computer*
Hiring a programer to do this shows the missunderstandings, because of the local infrastructure, allowed by windows. 
Where in the system should these levels to be sorted.. it is easier to give teachers access to everything and keep the local network in the organization (rivaled by teachers requiring a database).

The saving of sytems from the past require previous boxes to be saved. 

The separation between schools weren't cared for by the school owner. All users get *access* to the cathalogs, in almost the same way libraries have to pay for access to the publishers accounts(!) - natural?

So in the end paper survives....
