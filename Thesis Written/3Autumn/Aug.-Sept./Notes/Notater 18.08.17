The meaning of studying how research is perfomed in schools:

There are several aspects to the research question, all dawning on me very fast..

-The new pedagogies that already exist is not my conclusion, it is my beginning. Nevertheless, I build upon that to show how these pedagogies are being applied within informal environments to make up their own politics. 
-Designs that are being applied in the high-tech are filled with such politics. The high-tech is highly networked material constalations. 
-My RQ: then asks how is research performed within the high-tech sociology of education
Title: '(Knowledge without boundaries:) research performance within high-tech sociology of education'

-Windows comes into the picture when I look at how a researcher like Ole is experimenting with mobile devices. 
-Schools are not necessarily adopting external technology. In the new datascape we should ask whether work is being performed in schools, meant to liquidate and 'move' capital. In the current datascape data is processed continuously, and it is fundamentally productive. 
-This is what makes it relevent to discuss the way learning is changing into something akin to systematic research.

**The following consists of one quote: (p.255)**
"A focus on situated practices suggests an ethnographic approach whereby the context and practices are observed without seeking to control them. Undertaking such research is not a trivial undertaking: mobility challenges traditional practices of ethnographic study and new approaches are both needed and suggested (Höflich and Hartmann 2006), which requires stepping outside the literature of educational research and embracing other contemporary accounts of mobile device usage. Where else should we look for such a project? We must first move away from the essentialist positioning of these devices as ‘learning technologies’ and acknowledge instead that they are:
Developed and designed for various retail niches and corporate markets, certainly not for learning, however informal. This should not be a surprise; educational technology has always been parasitic, originally co-opting desktop computers intended for corporate business customers and now trying to co-opt mobile devices intended for individual lifestyle customers. (Traxler 2010, 150)" (p.255)

Continuing:
"Students today are accessing online courses from mobile devices. This is mobile learning happening in practice without institutional control of the device or context, but with a pressing need to understand who, when and how access is occurring." 
*What does it mean that there no longer exist 'institutional control of the device or context'? Governance (and state) needs to adapt to a datascape in which data is produced and processed separately from the social scientific apparatus.*

Projects to explore this creatively through looking at students’ everyday use of technologies, rather than specifically focusing on ‘mobile learning’ (see, for example, Jones, 2010), can give greater insight into situated practice compared with controlled quasi-experimental innovations. Engeström makes a similar call in his consideration of “wildfire activities”, noting that educators “tend to define top down the desirable patterns of mobility we want our mobile learners to engage in. The risk is that these patterns do not touch what is going on in the lives of the learners” (2009, 2). 
*It could on one side be seen as a 'dual approach' to mobile-learning tech (Lee.2), in which the motivations of 'users' (as he/she attends the course) are taken into consideration. However, in a post-human perspective the (digital)material has its own history (Turkle)* 
**If this is discussed in ch.2 then I will already be problematizing 'the centralization of computing'**
Engeström’s inquiry suggests that a focus on diverse situated practices, such as those of skateboarders, bird watchers and disaster relief workers, can provide insights unavailable from controlled studies."(p.255)
*I interprete this as a call for multi-cited ethnography*


-Giving kids and students the agency of researchers has some fundamental consequences..
