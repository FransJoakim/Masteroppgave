Dividing into chapters

Intro.ch.:
Learning about the internet - encountering the history of the decentralized social network standard
*New efforts at the verge of a tech-breach in the AI revolution

Ch.1 Co-ordination
p.2'Negotiating between learning materials to build common *curiculums*'
-How are these curiculums enmeshed in the building of large information systems
-p.2Learning goals as 'intersubjective interpretation/mediation'
*Teachers as many: p.11 Teacher as interactive/intersubjective. Difference (between users) created in categorical system. Demanding one kind of (organizational) literacy - ignoring others. Critical infrastructure seen over by the teacher who *transcribe* open software into accounting system attached to user (translation is done by computing/typing - AI transcends).

Ch.2 alignment - multiplicities in networks
*towards a de-centralized approach to curiculum-managment (L97>L06) - Constructing a 'learning analytics space'.
Epistemics: *hybrid communities* Different kinds of 'system' encounters. Curriculums seen in Kahoot, (behavior ordering)documents and other *instruments* FOR learning.
-Cybernetics as modeling (infrastructurement): shaping survailence or society?
>instead of observing negotiations of learning (as Star: CANT) we observe (post-human/SÃ¸rensen: emerging) spaces of imagination (Using Asdal to build on Suchman and Macknight).
>Bauer: many 'seeing' the few. *'access' as a 'different' question: studying the economization of mobile education. >reflexiveness and quality in 'free' sources of 'educational-research'. - The path towards finding 'learning analytics'.
-Studying market technologies in the technopedagogic complex
>empiri at the edu.tech. fair: recognizing 'Deep learning'(logos-genre) - 'making pattern recognition a startingpoint for network assimilation'
*Network assimilation: 'learning to be' and the stabilization of meaning within a computer landscape
> from intersubjectiveness to interactiveness ('song' phased out in secondary school - 'teachers just being one self')
-p.2How does new standards use/translate ideas of meta-data in continuous learning measurement systems?
*Meta-data as hardware(rasbery-pi in catalog): the history of software lies in the hardware - presence, use and ownership in computer history.
-p.10 Free software approach to education - the necessity of 'public' repositories
-p.10 Emerging *recursive* ethos(issue formation) - Mid-term impact trend: Shift from student as consumer to creators+collaborators (Horizon Report 20015 K12ed.)


Ch.3 Calculating degrees of convergence: How can one trace the boundaries between inside and outside in practice?(Callon p.149)
-The construction of weakness
p.2How does meta-data reconstitute the role and responsibilities (accountability) of the teacher (Martin Oliver in Education in cyberspace, cited in Selwyn, 2006).
