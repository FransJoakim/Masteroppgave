Notater 13.9.17 Interventions in experimental cultures (a good name for ch.2)

Sitting on the veranda in Haute de Cagnes:

I try to put into perspective the relationship between my interests in the office and the classroom: both which 'something is brought into'.
Theoretically I apply Mathuew Hull's writings in new ways. Also, I build on the idea of the learning organization in Dale et al. (2011). Combining these perspectives I question how the ontology of the office (an bureaucracy) is translated into education.

The idea developed while talking to Heidi Bergh-Hoff in Uninett, the day before our meeting. The conversation with Heidi made me aware of how efforts at standardizing de facto use-cases of LMS was working as a form of interestment among institutions: working with de facto standard organizations like the IMS global and cost-saving efforts meant to minimize confusions about the multiplicity of channels. 
 
I first thought of the role of the office when I was watching a promotion video from Accenture Lap in Sophia Antipolis. In the video one was presented with an imagined science park; an urban landscape without place (not Nice), but linked to a global infrastructure as sees on a european map. I ask my self what the video tells me about the role of Accenture. In the video we meet people in the office who are said to translate the big ideas in science into applications for use in industry and business. The translation process is demonstrated both through some of the display exibition which clearly point to some of the principles of 'cognetive computers', through *features* like facial recognition and traking. Moreover, we are shown pictures of (presumably) a researcher who are inspecting a robot. The inspection is also clearly staged, in the sense that the researchers is lifting the robot's arms and 'testing' its movements, what it could hold (fit), demonstrating what it could handle etc. - it is as if it demonstrates an idea of affordance. 

In my encounter with the video and the demonstration that illustrates the 'testing out functionality'. This 'analytical work' of discription begs the question of how realisticly the demonstration points to the 'value' of such analysis in the prescription processes that Accenture fascilitiates. 

My attention is drawn back to my early questions about the 'cultures of experimentation' and the translation of ontologies: what does it mean to be experimental.

The work I was doing with Uninet was important in this regard. Having gone from being a network providor to now fascilitating the procurment of network services. Having been a providor of an external data-channel they are now working with integrating some of these capacities. 

I end up with a dichotemy between different network infrastructures. The school system has, according to Foucault, has defined the bodey in relation to Norms. It has been an important fascilitator for the dispotif of the nomative relationship between bodies and Christian morals, or hygene and sickness. In more recent history the school also fascilitates for good behavior in a different way. In the form of socially addaptness and cutural capital. Christie's argument about the school that retains the young and economically useless is related to the 'becoming of social roles' and 'learning about the self and where one fits in. 

However, in the new 'designed' spaces of the school building one sees a renewed emphasis on the activation of the children. These forms of activation is now done within the infrastructure of the building architecture. The classroom, which has been the room/space for experimentation (with the teacher), the experience of learning is now governed outside: through observations of automation (controll of space).
The cognitive automation could be associated with the observation/experience of that which is automated (designed) - *something is made visible that also could have remained invisible. The design/er would want to demonstrate the meaning of having the computer center, and its affordance (in space). 

Cognetive automation could be associated with the observation of 'automation', and the demonstration of the 'meaning' of the computer/robot center. 
The computer and the digital both centre and merging into the background. It affords the question of what you can use it for - the semiotic practice. What could the computer be used for: In the same way that the national reference in books disappears into the background of the library (they are still there), the computer emerges: Not only does it affect the stability of facts in the biopolitical. The experimental equipment in the science room is for example minized - to be fascilitated on *screen*. Rooms around the building loose purpose and become fitted around uses associated with the disabilities of bodies (like the sensory room). The sensory experience of the group loose some importance, linked rather with the networked experience of being on the computer. 

In the same way that the national reference dissapeared into infrastructure, and became a boundary object, and the biopolitical resulted, now somethings else is *dissapearing into infrastructure* (black boxed) - the digital/network and the computer. The 3D installation on the SMART-board is not interactive in the networked sense. The 3D projector could automate much of the experience, bringing it closer to the student, but the presense with the laberatory as a right of passage disapears. And so would perhaps the experience of finding the material - the only real cultural reference that students would have with these forms of learning outside. One could for example view a dynamic heart, but how does it they transverse between the references associated with that animated heart. They could watch animations of 'real' places or historical sitatuions. But what does it got to do with references 'out there'. The sensory room could be thought to 'work' to calm the disabled kids. The 3D models (digital and analog) are fascinating objects (sensitising concept) that I came to associate with communities of practice who build models as machines - instruments for the organization of authoraty. 

One is left with a new form of authorative focus (SÃ¸rensen). While this socio-onology/political-economy remains similar, the economization of the space further strengthened earlier dichotomies. I want to describe this through the underlying dichotemy (in MacKnight) between the creative process and result. Process orientedness is a principle that I can show work as an operational element in everything from military, industry and education. The operation is the ordering of individual strategies of intervention, and it is a focus upon this aspect of the organization helps me move my focus towards the 'project oriented work' that underpins the games (the cone) of classification abstraction (choosing what level to play at).  


Granuality is highly valued: Autonomy (as highest granuality) is not easy to monitor and *produce* data.
This is the point in which reference points are established. In meeting with points of reference, as Lee explains, there are efforts made at establishing point of reference that i.e. draw something towards a market: co-producing markets and ... structure (systemness) in the chategorization of the groups under consideration. 

Granuality (as I was presented with in Lee) is an ambition that is in tention with the automus learning object. The reference point that interests these LO in markets are technologies of chategorization: it co-creates markets and as such information infrastructures. Like it said in Lee's chapter on learning objects 'Network' chategories of objects are described in a weird way, as they got nothing in common except from being retained within the category. You got not only the idea of a translation, but also a transversion.  

I observed this tension/separation in the IBM report, in which they promoted the monitor (monitization) of the materialities of learning for the sake of analysis devices. 
*Not only is the body within the classroom the grounds for experimentation and ideas of risk. 
The 'molecular' ontology is also used to move the focus towards something that is less of a biopolitics of the classes(groups) and more of a networked governmentality.  The designed space performs a cognitive automation. 


One of my arguments have been that one has to question what it means (when Bauer sais) that 'the many are now able to watch the few' - in terms of technological organizations. To a larger degree this refers to individuals in terms of the way their relationships with external documents are strengthened. Such 'references' are used in practice without explanation (automated/invisible).

*These technologies strengthened external documents links to experties, and i.e. monitizes access and authority to the teacher as the authoritative figure. They allow for action through standardization as prescribed. However, ideas like good, medium, bad, is associated with the temporality of 'skjellett planen' and curriculum 'goals'. The office, not the work of the teacher, separates between bureaucracy and their practices. And therefore, kids learn to relate to the rules (gamify) and are given responsibilities in relation to the abilities (basic skills) that they are imagined to behave according too. The younger kids are meanwhile monitored to a larger degree by gamified versions of internal references.

In the process of standardization one strengthens the regulators that monitizes. The temporality of these organization normalizes (growth/progress), and so one could observe effects like: like the curriculum being performed as behavioralist (in the sense of 'good behavior' - whats the word), the kahoot game in the 8th grade work as the christmas ball in the 10th and (furthermore) the *issue* with covering all of algebra at the 8th grade.



Infrastructure term: 
When the infrastructure terminology is strengthened it seems like it is the object itself that creates, or has created: that which establishes the narrative for the different objects that 'exist'. If its not important events in the 'social' metaphor, these creationist accounts are still important when one describes the objects that are imported/translated. 

As a learning organization the groups are 'thought' to do that form of research and learning. Knowledge is performed in this way. 

The network providor that now has become a procurement mediator is now active in the interestment of common standards among both the small and the large. This is because one is meant to establish forms of interactivity that works from the 'bottom up' (lower down). 

In the experimental space of Accenture labs one re-creates/re-scribe forms of intervention and monitization as in the other space. What motivates. What interests. What results in good behavior, as one shows through example. They perform forms of survailance that the cognitive is applied within. 

We have to remember that its not only the changing of society, such as business does, when they enact/place the monitization. In Callons model the opposite is equally important, which is counter intuitive. When changing the monitoring (devices) we could say that they *test ontologies* that are to be said to be monitored. 

This form of search that is performed in the survailance (information) society/economy the monitoring of one-self is as technologies of the self. It is important to for example establish cultural capital, or to 'gamify' the teacher/class-leader. In the same way that Foucault describes how tech. of the self makes the body a social object, the work of making learning a bodily object - a corpus of data, to use the IBM *metaphor*.  
In the same way the struggle to personalize has been ongoing (historically important). 

Perzonalisation (and individualization) is as such counter intuitive. To use an example from my empiri, it is counter-intuitive because the object that is held stable (i.e. maths function) is performed through an emerging network (irreversible). This way we can see these network as societies and as groups, associated with these objects. They are not associations of threat necessarily. 

This is as counter-intuitive as thinking about the music instrument as a search device. But when I observe how it is brought into rooms together with the computer interactivity is performed as search. The guitar performs search in the same way that the experiences of sounds etc. creates presence through its own affordability. The group could both try out the instrument and test/experience forms of affordance in the form of products - posible results. These products could be experienced through notes (or having learned a song previously), but one could also simply play songs on the computer. One could even find other instruments online to play instead, or along with. The posibilities are multiple. 

It is the experience that is in question in these situation. They emerge as cultural references. The reference is there to a lesser degree as a fact, or rigidly tied to a media, like an instrument. The instrument is experienced as multi-media. To be able (allowed) to *use* the instrument together with the computer could also be described as using the computer with the help of the instrument.

This has always been this way. They perform creativiy. Not only in organized form however accross the organization, like in MacKnight's account, but variously accross spaces: Like in the non-mandatory subjects that could be associated with imaginations of 'transformations of the self', or in the organization of 'model relationships' and established ways of local 'democracy' (these both apply instruction in an autonomous fashion: setting up a situation according to a previously perfomed format). 

One also got unorganized forms, in which the referenced also work in a participatory fashion. This is what is said to happen.. 
Observing that referential learning and participatory learning is done simultaneously I could conclude that 'structure' is not simply dichotomous in relation to the individual student. One could intervene in the lower end of the scale without giving the person more influence in the politics of the organization. They aren't necessarily given more rights (though they might be given the benefit of the situation). One could for example imagine how Mathis used digital means to change the game and expected associations that could be made with his 'power' and authority. 

My 'critique': The instruction is meant to minimize complexity. 
There are several strategies that exist parralell to eachother. Taking another example than the music-instrument. Search is performed on the computer as a way of testing the computer. Then one understands why the computer object (standard) is kept simple (rigid) by networks, in the same way that one could say that forms of instruments are simple as they lack structured (musician). A low degree of structure towards the abstract language of forms removes one from the 'code' language and is instrumented by the 'cognetive' level. 

That which disappears is complexity in the network (organization), and that which stabilizes the reference points - the network itself. Complexity within the network is lowered.
 In the same sense that we could say that the structure/progress in each subject depends on the teacher who mediates a 'logical' structure and order of progress, the secondary school is an arena for the 'mass production' (of learning instruction) : simplifying/limiting the posibilities of semantic meanings. The individual teacher structures a conversation around common reference points that he/she 'knows'. Without such knowledge of the strenght of references there is a weakness of association, with the teacher and with Media represented (the tree falling, or the health of the mass murderer). Weakness among the teachers are care for in the same way as that of the student. The teacher cannot cover all the algebra in the 8th grade. The students are supposed to know it all in the 10th, and how are you to re-perform that measurement after that amount of time?

The critique of gamification: the testing of the 'codes' is meant to disapear - as they do in the dynamic computers. At the organizational level, that which is monitored (I argue), it is clear for both me (substitute teacher) and the student that there are questions like how to navigate the different levels and boundaries. One thing is when external organizations are accountable for, and perform work, on (i.e.) computer. When for example the computer has been updated over the holiday. One becomes aware of how the organization work. 

This form of network organization depends on the integration of the high-tech. Such man refers to the organization of the space, not only the use of it. Organization in the sense of the networks that integrates other networks. Like an awareness in the organization of how to activate provdors that are accountable for their interests (functions like political rights).

Pragmatic philosophy consers with care, as it relates to the accountancy systems here, has to do with choice associated with efficiency. They are associated with simplicity and 'bodies'. This sense of economization is performed on and by the bodies and the learning subjects. All the way up to the subject-structure (said to be created by the teacher), down to (one's own) references to society, and individual work (references: as seen in exam). The subject-matter is performed through an analysis transversing these levels.

The epistemic consequences of these forms of transversion (between the levels) is that "the philosophy of the school allows pragmatic conserns to enter into the position of the analysis process in relation to the philosophy for objectives for learning". The objectives for learning could also be understood as objects for programation. 

Here I argue that the codes that the cognetive is performed within de facto standards disapear. It replaces the code, and de facto (social) standards disappears.

De facto standards are pragmatic conserns of efficiency. If one aims for a high level of granuality (structure) one looses the external standards. If standards are good, heterogeneity is what leads to de facto standards.
