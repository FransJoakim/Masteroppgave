I dag startet jeg med å slå opp anbefallingene til Joanna (fra USA). 

Lawn & Grosvenor, 2005. Materialities of schooling - design, technology, objects, routines. 

"The study of the workplace and the dvelopment of production often focuses upon the role of technology, from machines to systems of production. Contemporary discourses about education are foten expressed in terms of technological determinism or machine metaphors or prescribed actions, and overal in terms of performance. Less markedly, but consistently, there is a powerful discourse about schools as sites of consumption, growing over the decades, especially in periods of school building or innovation, but present now in the new way of viewing education as a profit making service." (p.8) - 'approach'

*I re-interpret the meaning of 'performance' according to more advanced STS
*I address both the technological determinism and the 'consumption' paradigm. 

-Consumption as productive is nothing new. The book gives good examples about the technoscientific complex that formed around the pencil, and the ability to know materials as a creative act that supported copying as industrial forms of work - 'plans'.
-What is the purpose of the deterministic account?

These authors progressed onto the 'critical' study of materialities as text. *This is the sort of text/semantics that I go beyond, as I look at emerging genres according to the 'values' of production.
**When Ingebjørg commented on the value the christmas ball was recognized to have (by the expert) we see evidence of 'traditions' and the ecology of the building/location (hallway conversation) finds its relevance in relation to the 'other' parts of the education plan. We see that new accountability measures are 'added on to', in a temporal co-construction of the school's evolution.



I de samme hyllene fant jeg også; 

Ed. Skjelbred & Aamotsbakken, 2011. Norsk lærebokhistorie III - en kultur- og danningshistorie.
Kap.15 Engh, K.R., 2011. Kunnskapssyn i utvikling. Et historisk perspektiv på forståelsen av kunnskap i lærebøkene for samfunnsfag i grunnskolen i lys av de to nasjonale læringsreformene, Læreplanverket av 1997 og Læreplanen Kunnskapsløftet 2006.

(Translated from Norwegian) A simple model is presented, refered to as Klafki's (2001) two perspectives. The first being the classical variatey of the material theory of didactics. Within this model the purpose of the instruction could be understood as to strengthen a positiv national identity. A  neutral subject orientation, with more or less factually-oriented presentations, that contributes to a harmonious understanding of society.
The opposite perspective is what Kaflki calls the formal theory of didaktics. Knowledge is here understood as a cause of personal growth and cultural capital. Neutral subject representations is replaced by a variety of perspectives, histories and relations of power effecting on events. It is not enough to know 'of'. It requires an understanding of how, the background, causality, relationships and individual agency.

*Translating 'dannelse' to english brought me back to the idea of cultural capital. 
'Dannelse', or (perhaps) 'Cultural education' is seen (by Aase, 2005) as an internal process, in which values are cared for through growth of consciousness (bevisthetsutvikling), ways of thinking and being (being present), that is shaped by fundamental values, knowledge and understanding within the culture that one belongs to. 

The L97 (Lærerplanverket) gave more weight to the active role of the students in the social sciences as the bearers of the democracy than previous reforms. The students were to be prepared for their civil duties through a belief in their own value, and being motivated to contribute to the community (fellesskapet means more like communal experience). 
*What is interesting is that acording to Ingebjørg the student-teacher relationship was defined by a minimum set of instructional materials. One could argue that the students were already then being **inscribed** as pro-sumers, in the sense that the lists of relevant materials gave ***value*** to their judgement, and not the teacher's judgement of what was relevant.

*The question is: How does one chose to **frame** reality when one is (very) limited in one's choise of media? Reality is otherwise judged by a critical approach towards the source/medium. Like when we read multiple articles and otherwise does ethnographies. Not to mention multi-cited ethnogrophies and triangulated methods. 
*The 'competence goal' of **critically assessing** sources (online) is one of the central tenants of the governments strategy towards valuating digital literacy skills. The idea assumes there to be inherent value to the 'source' and not the medium, just like the idea of de-bunking 'false news' online (marres). Engh argues that in the education plan 'conflict' is downplayed, and we see evidence that rather the question of legitimacy arrise. This confirms the theory of government legitimacy within a civil infrastructure that was studied in digital STS. It also raises questions like 'how do you establish the legitimacy of a google search?'
*I argue that my theory is simply a new way of seeing the world - the blackboard as genre, 'more than' scripted. How is that possible? Because I observe through the post-foucauldian reality of 'technologies of the self/community(post-social)'.

Engh writes that understanding the past is important to be able to plan for the future. This is a rational understanding of learning. He contiunes by noting that ecological terminology is introduced for the first time in L97. It is used in relation to the economy and technology, but not in relation to the ecological responsibility of students in a national or global perspective. Responsibility is a term that I recognize from Christie's book - associated with rights. 
  Within the ecological metaphor we see that among the human types presented here the working human is closely associated with the co-operative/colaboraitive and the environmentally conscious person. An actor perspective is absent. 
*Children as such learn 'about media', as the ecology concept is 'translated' into the school at a molecular level: they go beyong the cell and understand the cybernetics of it. "life and death and such" is discussed 'in relation' to the genres of 'objective' writing. 
*We have to ask whether the assumption that planes are taken into the classroom to be studied overestimates the actor role of the observers (students) in the organization. 

*actors* does not feature into the 'boundary work' performed in these documents - within the narative of the (rational/cognitive) 'formal analysis of evolution'. This is a continuing trend in the 'formal'(Klafki in Engh) terminology in the KL06.
Transnational space as neither 'globalization' nor 'nationalization'. What agency are students given in the nihilation of the subject-object boundaries of the digital (Latour on social media as well as Suchmann on imagined bodies), and how does this matter in the virtual classroom.
-Cognitive 'development' (utvikle) replaces work (with) as a form of engangement social science (methods) that assumes co-operaiton and colaboration to be the same (samarbeid in a norwegian perspective, also giving democracy a single form).
