###From calculation to alienation: disentangling economic abstraction

1. p.237 In the span between Callon and Miller my theoretical question emerges:
- **Can we in any productive way identify markets as generic social types within schools?**

+Reminds me of Law's (1992) discussion of the general findings in his notes on ANT theory - in addition to the "empirical conclusion that translation is contingent, local and variable". His 4th. and last finding is the 'issue of the scope of the ordering'. Despite having pressed the view that the process is local he argues also that it is possible to impute somewhat general *strategies of translation* to networks. Strategies which, like Foucauldian discourses, ramify through and reproduce themselves in a range of network instances or locations. He makes sure to point that the reader should "[n]ote that if these exist, they are more or less implicit- for explicit strategic calculation is only possible if there is already a center of translation"
Law's argument turns our attention to the organization. He writes that: "What might such strategies look like? This, again, is an empirical matter. But since no ordering is ever complete, we might expect a series of strategies to coexist and interact. This, at any rate, is the claim made by several actor-network writers. Thus, in a recent study of management, I have detected a range of strategies - "enterprise," "administration," "vocation," and "vision" - which collectively operate to generate multi-strategic agents, organizational arrangements, and inter-organizational transactions. Indeed, the argument is that an organization may be seen as a set of such strategies which operate to generate complex configurations of network durability, spatial mobility, systems of representation, and calculability--configurations which have the effect of generating the center/periphery asymmetries and hierarchies characteristic of most formal organizations."(p.388-389)

+Moreover Law's argument reminds us of the challenges of studying standards of infrastructure pointed to in Star and Bowker
- the realm of ubiquitous media and *external networks, like the ICT sector: Windows*.

- Does for example, a teacher negotiate a program within a classroom when he picks a product off the digital shelves of today? Is s/he introduce a 'scientifically' proven method (program of action)?
+ Does he reconfigure the past (economization)
- Is s/he simply enforcing the internal dynamics of the organization on a sett of unruly kids? *how to look beyond descriptions local adoption*

- Two further questions about *transactions as abstraction*
+ what are the 'contracts' in the outcome economy that characterize the digital element; the 'logic' behind hindering a complete transaction of ownership.
+ How are services abstracted? How are "broader social connections" sustained and mediated?

- How are services institutionalized according to the distribution of societal functions (*documents*) across hierarchies etc.?
+ How does the abstraction rationalize *value creation*; perform *accountability*

- "a key issue is precisely the *relationship between individual transactions and long-term commitment*, and **how this is to consensually framed and formalized**" (p.240)
- For a service provider to reproduce its position a vendor within a platform-system it requires an ethical framework that could intervene in political and cognitive 'contestations'.
+ These *'fuzzy' boundaries* is established through *continuous* 'stretching outwards from the market, towards ever wider social technologies (cognitive) and institutions'.


###Researching decentralized databasing

1.Virtual databases
- What role does the data gate play in the effort at *harmonizing virtual databases* (like Kahoot etc.) play in the framing of such rationals of economization?
+ How do you study the co-creation of database infrastructure that surpass ordinary internally organized systems - including artificial intelligence?

2.Blockchain and 'databases as inscription device'
+ What does it mean that these standards assures quality through mechanisms of 'trust as computed'

3.Theorizing IT as infrastructure (3 poles of Callon's TEN description)
- How to understand the role of innovation within basic educational institutions & regulations.
+ How are limits imposed on the government as (*market*) innovator: separation performed through the assurance of its own presence in the future-making of public domains.
+ Co-creating corporate Ed- *tech* and the future organization (Keegan).
+ How *science* work is performing as frames of investment & innovation - *technologies of validation* (Foucault).

4.The valuation of learning itself (life itself: Rose)
- How are subjects performed within ICT infrastructures?
+ Groups/individuals pieces together information that breaks the mold of 'learning in controlled environments' (ways of knowing), yet there is a difference between associating as thought/'opinion' and the fact-checking of the Internet institutions: *discipline of fluid technologies*
+ These institutions capitalize on those breaking the mold of SN (treason to database/repository): repository associated with the body of the teacher
- How is such '*referential* presence' resisted in classroom and its SN?
