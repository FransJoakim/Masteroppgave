¤¤Dette kapitellet skal introdusere leseren for conteksten skapt igjennom utbyggingen av dataporten. Ved å gjøre dette vil jeg måte introdusere leseren for måten jeg har blitt kjent med verdiene i dette rammeverket (Singelton) og samtidig introdusere en kritisk stemme som spør hvor kategorier og issue kommer fra (Asdal).
-hvordan kan jeg foreksempel argumentere for at Uninett, Oslo Kommune og Læringskomiteen tilhører et nettverk: være empirisk i studiet av deres relasjoner..
- Jeg går også lengre enn Asdal. Jeg følger Tone når jeg forklarer hvordan den Norske stat er avhengi av en transnational infrastruktur, og gjør et forsøk på å syntesere dette når jeg tar for meg hvordan dette blir 'sikkerhets'politikk og en økonomisk nødvendighet (Ludvigsen utvalget's sosialdemokratiske kompromiss-orienterte ekspertise)

¤ 'learning cell' differs from atomus learning objects by being part of a ubiquitous learning environment and drawing upon kinds of cybernetic value frameworks. 

*Form 4: New Work Item Proposal: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36 - N 3619*
The standard aims to facilitate:
1. Developing a framework for describing learning resources, and provide contextual properties, which
will help situated learning. And framework will allow recording social relations as a basis for socialized
learning. Moreover, it will preserve information recording the evolvement of the resource.
- Helping situated learning: *Sørensen* and the recording of social relations - that which is socialiezd
- Information is preserved in the 'resource' through histories and an ecological metaphor.

*Spørsmål: hvordan skal jeg referrere til disse dokumentene?*

#ch.1 Creating context as the facilitation of 'Dataporten' as a standardization measure in Norwegian educational information infrastructures.


It is neither surprising nor self-evident that the standard for the measurement and accounting for learning has changed over the last few decades.
The school system has been widely criticized for not changing the way it organizes learning activities in this new revolutionary century. This criticism however comes..

On the other hand, in the school system the mantra of learning management has changed. In the documents produced for the international associations for educational development (* ) there is now talk of a transition from a paradigm of 'evaluation OF learning' to the practice of 'evaluation FOR learning'. The reform was implemented in the years that I was working as a teacher-substitute, and the literature was to be found to be circulating widely.

This comes in response to the opening up of transnational measurement mechanisms.


##Digital monetization
So what does these mantras got to do with the facilitation of Digital Rights Management (DRM) system?
The data gate is opening up new possibilities for the measurements of learning. The picture that decorates the opening page of this chapter also shows the expectations and ... frontier

As it says on its (English) website that:

"UNINETT's service platform, Dataporten (Norwegian for "data gate"), is a shared component of the education sector which connects data sources and end-user applications. Typical data that can be shared through Dataporten is both personal and group data, but also other information, such as whether the student has paid tuition or not. The users of data port determines what should be shared there." @uninett_service_nodate

This 'shared component' underpins a service platform that *my translation follows* @uninett_dataporten_nodate helps the (Norwegian) educational institutions keep in order which services that receive what information. My translation shows a more pedagogic and inclusive account of the service. One in which the 'shared component' is perhaps best understood as the platform itself, and the service seen as an element of an organization of national 'Norwegian' educational institutions. On the English website such meaning resides in the components 'shared' nature.

This interpretation of the techno-economic network is itself a central component in the present day genres of digital economies. The 'sharing economy' as it has become known is a product of the post-dot-com bubble digital landscape, and in throughout this chapter my investigation into the temporality its translation throughout the education sector.

The monetization could be seen as an 'force' of such magnitude that few other changes in human history has ever had a larger impact on the way we organize our economies. And what is more, it could be argued that these systems are in their pre-application stage. On the other hand, information has always had its value. And put in the light of ANT inspired accounts of valuation, money works as carriers of information. It does not only exchange value, but by working as sorts of calculative devices it allows for value creation.

The extent to which the data gate work as a calculative device is here in question. It allows for abstraction to happen.
How does the data gate matter to the 'social lives' of the inscriptions that result from the translation process of transnational and local measurement mechanisms? Or put differently, how does it effect the materiality of learning?

The monetization of the exchange of data works on the premise of a technical fixture that interests providers of IaaS in the frameworks of the conditions mediated by the portal.


##Monetization and surveillance



Our understanding of monetization and surveillance practices are intimately linked. And its theorization is furthermore linked with studies of the education sector.
