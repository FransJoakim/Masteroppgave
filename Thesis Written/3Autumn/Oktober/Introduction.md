We are talking theoretical technologies in the plural..


**Infrastructure inversion**
*"Each theme operates as a gestalt switch—it comes in the form of an infrastructural inversion (Bowker 1994). This inversion is a struggle against the tendency of infrastructure to disappear (except when breaking down). It means learning to look closely at technologies and arrangements that, by design and by habit, tend to fade into the woodwork (sometimes literally!). Infrastructural inversion means recognizing the depths of interdependence of technical networks and standards, on the one hand, and the real work of politics and knowledge production on the other. It foregrounds these normally invisible Lilliputian threads and furthermore gives them causal prominence in many areas usually attributed to heroic actors, social movements, or cultural mores. The inversion is similar to the argument made by Becker (1982) in his book Art Worlds. Most history
and social analysis of art has neglected the details of infrastructure within which communities of artistic practice emerge. Becker's inversion examines the conventions and constraints of the material artistic infrastructure and its ramifications. For example, the convention of musical concerts lasting about three hours ramifies throughout the producing organization. Parking attendants, unions, ticket takers, and theater rentals are arranged in cascading dependence on this interval of time. An eight­hour musical piece, which is occasionally written, means rearranging all of these expectations, which in turn is so expensive that such productions are rare. Or paintings are about the size, usually, that will hang comfortably on a wall. They are also the size that fits rolls of canvas, the skills of framers,"* (**p.34(pdf)**)

*Standards, categories, technologies, and phenomenology are increasingly converging in large­scale information infrastructure. As we have indicated in this chapter, this convergence poses both political and ethical questions. These questions are by no means obvious in ordinary moral discourse. For all the reasons given above, large­ scale classification systems are often invisible, erased by their naturalization into the routines of life. Conflict and multiplicity are often buried beneath layers of obscure representation. Methodologically, we do not stand outside these systems, nor pronounce on their mapping to some otherworldly "real" or "constructed" nature. Rather, we are concerned with what they do, pragmatically speaking, as scaffolding in the conduct of modern life. Part of that analysis means understanding the coconstruction of classification systems with the means for data collection and validation. To clarify our position here, let us take an analogy. In the early nineteenth century in England there were a huge number of capital crimes, starting from stealing a loaf of bread and going on up. Precisely because the penalties were so draconian, however, few juries would ever impose the maximum sentence; and indeed there was a drastic reduction in the number of executions even as the penal code was progressively strengthened. There are two ways of writing this history: one can either concentrate on the creation of the law; or one can concentrate on the way things worked out in practice. This is very similar to the position taken in Latour's We Have Never Been Modern (1993). He argues that we can either look at what scientists say they are doing (working within a purified realm of knowledge) or at what they actually are doing (manufacturing hybrids of nature­culture). We think both are important. We advocate here a pragmatic methodological development—pay more
attention to the classification and standardization work that allows for hybrids to be manufactured and so more deeply explore the terrain of the politics of science in action.

The point is that both words and deeds are valid kinds of account. Early sociology of science in the actor­network tradition concentrated on the ways in which it
comes to appear that science gives an objective account of natural order: trials of strength, enrolling of allies, cascades of inscriptions, and the operation of immutable
mobiles (Latour 1987, 1988). Actor network theory drew attention to the importance of the development of standards (though not to the linked development of
classification systems), but did not look at these in detail. Sociologists of science invited us to look at the process of producing something that looked like what the
positivists alleged science to be. We got to see the Janus face of science as both constructed and realist. In so doing we followed the actors, often ethnographically.
We shared their insights. Allies must be enrolled, translation mechanisms must be set in train so that, in the canonical case, Pasteur's laboratory work can be seen as a
direct translation of the quest for French honor after defeat in the battlefield (Latour 1988).
By the very nature of the method, However, we also shared the actors' blindness. The actors being followed did not themselves see what was excluded: they
constructed a world in which that exclusion could occur. Thus if we just follow the doctors who create the ICD at the WHO in Geneva, we will not see the variety of
representation systems that other cultures have for classifying diseases of the body and spirit; and we will not see the fragile networks these classification systems subtend. Rather, we will see only those who are strong enough and shaped in such a fashion as to impact allopathic medicine. We will see the blind leading the blind....

Resistance
Reality is 'that which resists,' according to Latour's (1987) Pragmatist­inspired definition. The resistances that designers and users encounter will change the ubiquitous
networks of classifications and standards. Although convergence may appear at times to create an inescapable cycle of feedback and verification, the very multiplicity
of people, things and processes involved mean that they are never locked in for all time.
The methods in this chapter offer an approach to resistance as a reading of where and how political work is done in the world of classifications and standards, and
how such artifacts can be problematized and challenged. Donald MacKenzie's (1990) wonderful study of ''missile accuracy" furnishes the best example of this
approach. In a concluding chapter to his book, he discusses the possibility of "uninventing the bomb," by which he means changing society and technology in such a
way that the atomic bomb becomes an impossibility. Such change, he suggests, can be carried out in part at the overt level of political organizations. Crucially for our
purposes, however, he also sensitizes the reader to the site of the development and maintenance of technical standards as a site of political decisions and struggle.
Standards and classifications, however dry and formal on the surfaces, are suffused with traces of political and social work. Whether we wish to uninvent any
particular aspect of complex information infra­structure is properly a political and a public issue. Because it has rarely been cast in that light, tyrannies of various sorts flourish. Some are the tyrannies of inertia—red tape—rather than explicit public policies. Others are the quiet victories of infrastructure builders inscribing their politics into the systems. Still other are almost accidental—systems that become so complex that no one person and no organization can predict or administer good policy.* **(p.47-50 pdf)**

I think it is still relevant to study use ANT. As seen in the second paragraph above the way study of techno-economic networks also involves the study of how surveillance changes the world around it....

I try to apply Sørensen analysis of 'the materialities of learning' to the study of information infrastructures. Meaning that

This fits in to a broader trend of sociomaterialism.  
broader field of the study of the 'materialities of schooling'... spaces of the school.



Like Star and Bowker, I go one step further than Star did in her study of Boundary Object. I do not simply assume to study communities of practice. Many of the spaces are shared by different staff. One could not simply say that some meetings build new boundaries, because the boundaries are rather re-negotiated across several forums.


-by doing this I want to return to ANT. Fenwick and Edwards is known for their application of ANT in educational research, but their research is also vulnurable critiques of applying ANT as theory (Law - refered to by Kristina). Fenwick rather makes a move towards a sociomaterialist account, which is similar to the notion of the materialities of schooling, except for Fenwicks approach to topologies.

Using an approach the 'emerging' complexity of the 'cloud' as a 'place' - seen through the struggle over the LMS - I argue that the history of actants (CHANT) is caught up in processes of 'placing resources'. Understanding the value of studying the institution means being able to describe the act of valuation, and the strength of complexity theory is to describe the school as a moving mass.

Star's feminist (reflexive) approach to the act of research ... (?)






##Value studies

I question the pragmatist approach to the role of the mediator and the work of caretaker. Two roles are combined, like in the study of NAV, in a way that the relationship between these interests. One one side there is the co-construction of the instructional design and technology, and on the other conserns with the individualization process (looking at the interest of the subject in the 'choreography of ontologies').

This could be understood as two forms of value (ansvar og kvalitet boka): self-interest and social value. It could be understood as the move towards understanding social value institutionally (foucualt's respons to marxist political economy). Rather than applying a traditional social scientific question to an online setting through innovative ethnography - seeing the desktop bureaucracy in action - I use an ethnographic study into the online to study the formation of 'digital information'. I try to ask a digital studies question to a traditional social scientific phenomena.

The process of institutionalization is seen here as a struggle over social rationality - a Weberian and Foucauldian critique - in which that which is performed in the institution is also an act of valuation.

-I see that harmonization is important value in the work of translating transnational standards into (the territory of) Norwegian education cultures.
-This approach to neo-liberal governance (or late foucualdianism) is useful to understand the way 'many are beginning to watch the few'
-The language of the meta is becoming an arena for the formation of issues based on institutional platforms, as **the 'ubiquity of media' comes into question**
-What is the integrity of information (devices) that one has access to?

We watch this issue develop through the formation of boundaries, the valuation (and ordering) of different designs, and the formation of new hybrid standards of labor in the new global space of the 'Internet of Things'.


##method
Talking of methodology I want to discuss the way I have assured the reflexivity of my work. Much has already been said about the significance of the 'reflexive move' in the history of STS.
-I write myself and my intervention into the story
-I actively re-scribe: therefore I am methodological
