 

Selling your data waste: valuating and evaluting the waste products of your online activity
-the government has an interest in selling the waste products that are not for sale in the personal-computing market. It is now competing with the private market. while it is selling the data it is paradixically also hoping to translate a form of public ownership ethos into the new economies of transnational and international edtech - selling the scandinavian model of education. 

It is waste because it is a pardadigm of recording failed attempts, and not simply guaranteing success according to criteria 'observed' in the pedagogic research communities; technopedagogy is transformed by the risk (outcome based) economy, but risk is also problematicly translated into a public resource - a contested object. The mediation of failures calls for an attuned frontstage/backstage division.

The Norwegian government is willing to risk some kind of direct insight into the processes 'behind' the Norwegian apparatus, and in that way also sell these data in exchange for analytical capasities. Both by me and by other researchers. 


**While writing about dataporten standard in ch.1 I think I will present it in the context of the school and its emergence in my methodological approach. The chapter will beginn with a story 'telling approach':
>I begin by discussing how I first came upon considering Feide as a core technology. That was in the IT-support office in the school. This takes me into an account of my strategy within the participatory observation I did - coming in a little under the radar, to 'figgure things out' 
*(I am part of a *recursive* public').
-At first I didn't find the office because I wasn't expecting the IT-support to have its own office and I didn't know how to turn a study about education into an observation of a hybrid role and its wider role (which he didn't know too much about).
-Regarding Feide; I had primarily been concerned with FinTech, and the role of systems like Visma. The fact that I could follow a register-technology like Feide was surpricing at the time. It didn't help me in any direct way to access the local infrastructure. Looking back, these technologies was probably one of the hurdles.
