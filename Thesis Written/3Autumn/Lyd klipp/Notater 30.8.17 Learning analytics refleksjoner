Youtube video from LASI 2017:

The question that he was asking was how does learning analytics play a role in the age of cognetive automation and the learning data explotion (augmented age). Cognetive automation fits very well with the questions I have posed. It produces imaginative bodies, that associate with bodies that aren't acutally wearing 'wearable augmentation devices'. These he calls IA - intelligent augmentation. This means that that which is being augmented has a basis of genuin learning. 

They are now measuring and quantifying indicators of learning in which learning does mean more than simple achievements of different kinds, and he discusses (the scary fact) how they now become responsible for what to do with these data.

(coffee break)

The harder concepts:
A triangle - empiry, evaluation and pedagogy (didn't quite remember at the time).
The point was that the model demonstrated the position of the researchers relative to the 'middle space'. What is interesting for me is the talk of survailance within that space. His examples raised questions like how one goes above and beyond the LMS. This means that one goes outside the school, and gather data from other platforms (FB, tweeter) - building on a social media ontology. 

This ontology associates with their epistemological standpoint. They are positioned in a way that they are able to measure indicators like agency. They establish network nodals between the students. Or, alternatively, he speeks of the scary scenario when universities are actually tracking students around campus, registring in whether they are participating in different fora - like buying collage swethers, going to study groups.

What is interesting is that these data create indicators of individual profiles, and how they resemble one another. Their profile isn't normally talked about in the same way as profiles online, in the social media ontology. Social survailance works  about many of the same indicators. They are used for interventions of different kinds. Here perhaps with a spatial focus. 

It is in the space between the two example studies he mentioned that I lie (online and offline). There is therefore room to analyse learning analytics as a discipline in development, in which we study where the political organs that they represent stand. Once again one have two examples given. Those who own LMS, in which learning analytics is integrated. And then second you have a group that is made up of academics who are gaining interest as it is becoming clear how knowledge work is affected. 

My concern is with the position of the computer scientists. In the video he talks alot about the position his centre has, which is very interesting. These are reflections that he made himself towards the end. His centre stands side-by-side with the IT deparment, and is emerging as another student-oriented-service 

(**'SOS' would be an interesting contrast with SMS** - then what is the difference between a service and a system? Is this a topic that is covered by my investigation into cloudification??) 

The example of thise organizational structure is interesting in relation both to the way I see the UiO is restructuring their new learning centre. It is important to see that the new centre is a political organ. There are perhaps some important and interesting differences between this political organ and the SOS at the University of Michigan. In stead of standing next to IT support as an SOS they now have new powers (perhaps in the same way the political organs in Michigan has had all along). As a political organ they 'push', and are now able to tell faculties what they have to do. Whether the centre at UiO will have the power to influence the establishment of new programs etc. is however doubteful. 

The difference this perspective has when studying the secondary school system, the centres in Lierskolen does not have a pedagogic role. I saw how the PC is not considered as an object of interest to these organs in any other way than to maintain the service system and negotiate terms. The IT centre doesn't get involved to improve practice. On the other hand the school lets some individual students have the agency to take care of the computer. 
this is an interesting difference between the University that is making this move towards centralized regulator of a decentralized internal network. The new network works as a cloud, but there are interesting differences between the GitHub cloud and the 365. 

Secondly, it is interesting to think of the role of the student in relation to the tutor. The student that I now mentioned has established agency through a sort of 'ownership'. The important question is how the school approaches this issue (problematikk). What I observe is that agency stays with the textbook, and what students 'need to know'. This is a practice that is strengthened by new measurement systems. 


What is moreover interesting is the construction of weakness. In the sociology of treason the consturction of weakness could be explained as relevant as the new learning analytics program is based on the idea of having room for failure. The construction of weakness is care for failure in this perspective. This analysis openes up for new thought. This is perhaps not done before. 

I should move on to get back to 'agency'. Agency is effected by this construction. The lecturerer draws on a quoute by Dewey, who talks about will. The issue of analysing will is the basis for my quesiton of how 'research is performed in schools' as well as Callon's symetrical framework - calculative devices.


The lecturerer also draws in examples of 'high-tech' and 'low-tech' approaches to learning analytics. This difference is an important theoretical goal in my analysis. Ole Sm√∏rdal and Kahoot I imagine as low-tech, but the high-tech is the basis of my analysis. It is very interesting to observe these technologies in relation to eachother, and their shared presence with older technologies. The technology already in place is so strong and important for the development of learning data. 

High-tech is used to re-create complex relationships in the materialities of instruction. 365 is simply used to re-create (translate) the lesson schedule online - cloudify. It turns out it is not so simple to achieve as one would have thought. The failure manifests this. 

**The schedule is not easily translated because the media in the different classes does not translate to the same format. One would think that one was following one group of students, and there wouldn't be a problem saving materials to the correct folders. Yet, each group was represented several times over. One time within each slot, in which new materials are deliberated and the class is reinvented. 
**For example, one could think of what Anna said about covering a topic all at once, and covering it in **depth**. However, this would not allow the group to reinvent itself as an advanced class. The idea that the group should know this and that before that time is the only indicator of this paradigm in the corriculm text was they should be familiar with this and that. The teacher is allowed to pick what is thought. However, harmony is indicated as being an important value. This is decicevly effected by text-book progression, but also by topical values. Minimizing conflict among the symbolic values of the different languages of maths means isolating the symbols: learning to draw charts, write example texts etc. All in relation to the value of the symbol. 
+It is the formula-approach to maths that is being linked to simple activities like charts, not the constructivist approach to formula making. Other ways of approaching and associating with the problems could extent the network in irregular ways.



The high-tech example in the youtube video is a woman that constructs a game that measures and quantify conscientiousness. I see this as a combination of empathy and self-consciousness. This is an difficult thing to measure, but its dimentions are reduced through the construction of a game. The design of the game inscripts a lot of heterogeneity through these qualities. In this example the game reduces heterogeneity by refering back to the individual.  This is interesting because of the game-ontology as well as the fact that agency translated into a loop, with the goal of visualisation. 

Making consciousentiousness visual is a form of dynamic object oriented programing that I am interested in. Dealing with heterogeneity by reflecting it back at an individual is a new form of individualization, in which one creates profiles. However, profiles are made visual. As something we relate to as something between the individual and society. 
*The ontology of the profile - Latour. 

Individual computing: The way he talks about computing creates a background for my narrative. The standard is a form of visualization. Learning Design happens at a different level then. The design objects themselves works as boundary objects. The design tools aren't simply things that makes you adapt, but you adapt your computer. Through this one then takes conscious desicions about the way one adapt and parttake (or not) in gamification. 



So how does this fit into my thesis????

To make something visual is a topic that I recognize from Bowker - memory work. It also fits into user-studies, in the sense that the user also partake in the visualization/textualization (imagining) of how a system is meant to be used. The way a system is used is also a concern with the choice of learning. In the feminist/multicultural perspective (book about media in education) recistance is argued to be under-studied, but from their (and more recent) perspective - the 'flank move' - these questions are not 'seen' in the social sciences. These forms of agency (authority and control) are done outside of the experimental frames of these traditional concerns - ruppert et al.

Going full circle:
When recistance happenes in relation to learning objects, it happens in a classroom. Writers like Christy looks at agency in these spaces, in a way that also S√∏rensen studies. 

Agency is important to what the school is - sociologically. This critical approach is in many ways the those that actors outside of the political interests of the school takes, and it is that which teachers work with. There one could have an understanding of a weakning of values of i.e. remembering, facts and pedagogical approaches of objectivism. 

The fact that students can create groups that are not under survailence reflects this change. They are allowed to 'consume' the PC. It positions the school differently than previous, like shown by among others lektor Melby. The position of the teacher could be seen as related to the conditions - experimental culture - in higher education. *I see it as the systems of validity. 

Constructivism is an example of an intervention into these 'porouse' boundaries. It is a form of boundary thinking (work), but is performed in specific ways. The construction of weakness that happens in the school administration strengthens the teacher and perserves the agency of the students. However, since it is understood through the perspective of the teacher the design is performed through the imaginations of pedagogies of competence. The digital competence is about the critical approach to 'sources', and the consistent 'critical' position of the educational institutions.

The virtual form of governance remains unproblematic. We then return to questions of i.e. the position of the university. The university used to be the centre of idealogical struggle, but it is perhaps less so in the networked understanding of knowledge. I should be conscious of what responsibility and quality will mean in the emerging market (Silje's oppgave). The source is a form of quality assurance. 

Efforts at establishing digital standards is done at a political level. One could find similarities between the university and the school, in which the political technologies is established at a level in which agency, democracy, creativity, etc. is defined through cultural values. Also in relation to boundary objects and the digital - search and your researcher perspective. 

The municipality remains to be administrators, and the administrative level is accountable in relation to the politicians. It is part of a new public management parradigm. It is not about to change. 

The expert report intervens however. In adition to be a temporal agenda-maker, it also has the role in the digital politics (jasinoff) as expertise. Consensus politics represents that which already exists, and critical perspectives with that which exists is not understood. I.e. UDIR's controversial position and the establishment of transnational standards.

Ludvigsen utvalged is critical towards accountablity in relation to 'depth', and the standard of the user-experience. That it is a deeply rooted experience, and that one should delve deeper into the role of the user. Place him/her as a centre in a nodal metaphor. It is both meant to give the student deeper forms learning and at the same time display the student as enganged in this. 

The second thing it does is separate between 'dannende' and instructional values. In danningen deep cultural references are important. 

The cultural references that I have observed in this perspective it is problematic. In my ethnography, in the Norwegian class in which groups reflected on their own experience in the subject, few partook in the cultural references - book, chapter, topic. Cultural references are downplayed, because they are problematic to evaluate. Especially when teacher's authority is to re-established and a new ethics to be created.
