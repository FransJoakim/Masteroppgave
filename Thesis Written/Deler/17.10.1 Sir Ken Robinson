Christie sier Hvis skolen ikke fantes at skolen er et sted hvor barn oppbevares til de skal ut i arbeid og mens deres foreldre er i arbeid.. Jeg skriver heller om den ’naturlige’ veksten tilknyttet avkutting fra samfunnet og den kreative prosessesen av å beskue samfunnet ’der ute’ med læreren.


**Sir Ken Robinson**

Children starting school today will be retiring in 2065. Nobody got a clue, despite all the experties that’s been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five year’s time… So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.”

“...Kids will take a chance. If they don’t know, they will have a go. Am I right? They’re not frightened of being wrong… by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong… We are now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst things that you can make. And the result is that we are education people out of their creative capacities...”

“Something strikes you… when you go around the world: Every education system on the earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. It doesn’t matter where you go. You wouldn’t think it would otherwise, but it is. On the top is mathematics and langauges, then humanities, and the bottom are the arts. Every where on earth. And in pretty much every sustem too, there’s a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance.” 

*Evnen til å beskrive har vært forstått som viktig, enten med språk (inkludert matte), historisk, eller kunst. Dette skifter i det digitale. Jeg skriver om skiftet mot et system der alle former for læring skal ha samme status, og hvordan dette endrer forholdet til kroppen og deres læringsidentitet*

«We educate our children from the waist up, and then slightly to one side. I you were to visit earth as an ailien say «what’s it for, public education?» I think you’d have to conclude, if you look at the output... the whole purpose of public education around the world is to produce university professors. Their the ones that come out on top.» 

In the next thirty years more people around the world will be graduation from higher education than in the rest of history... suddenly degrees aren’t worth anything... Its a process of academic inflation... And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.

After having seen Al Gore speak about ecology he sais «I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconsitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity. And for the future it won’t serve us.
