The cloud question is a question of rights. I cannot separate the question of personal information management and the GDPR fram any other aspect of cloud computing. 

In part one this is the reason why the politics of 'evaluation for learning' is so important. How should these identity factors be handled? Noone wants to be responsible.. 
In part two I discuss Ludvigsen utvalget is politicising the question of handling multiple sources for learning. 






Part 1
Ch.1. The ubiquitous media – paper and cloud technologies
-What is the cloud? A grounded approach to the context of the Internet
-The school as its own boundary: observing interactions with ‘the Internet’

In this chapter I follow the mobile devices that make up the computer network in the students digital learning environment. It is no one boundary between the extended network of the teachers, the administration, the national registry, and the Internet. Rather these systems needs to be studied in a distributed fashion, as the mesh they entangle with in the contexts they are designed for. 

In this chapter I follow the flow of students across the different spaces of the classroom, from the highly visually oriented science room, to the different forms of social-constructions in the teacher-lead classroom, the communal networking of the gamified Christmas party, and the ‘individualized’ work of the task-based class.

The classroom represents the devices differently, meshing together subject-specific materialities of learning, in ways that enact the legitimacy codes of the subject. The computer network is not only entangled with heterogeneous instruments for instruction, but they variously also also entangle with each other, and are simulated by other instructional instruments in the cloud. The computer works across different windows applying different architectures.


Ch.2. Accounting for the teaching subject (and/or object)
-The cloud, the digital and the virtual; multiplum rammer og det interactive sin mulighet til oppdeling og deling.
-Essentialism and the difficulty of observing ‘sharing’; i.e. encountering talk of google sheets in class leadership (in article and in Simons presentation).
-contact teachers use similar tools, just in a very limited sense. Subject-teachers use them (the online form, as onenote is a hybrid of) without the same agency, and do treason quite regularly.
*Problems with the network cause me to see the benefits of the offline. 

-The kernel and the changing ontology of the school-space; the personal and the productive.
In this chapter I quickly show that it is fairly easy to make judgements about the way teachers adapt tasks (i.e. exam) to the way that subjectivity is based on loose ideas of creativity

-The controversy of groupings (beyond dichotomy of groups vs networks) and the legitimacy of teaching.
>*how are publics cared for (?)
-The re-construction and ethics of ‘access’ and the mapping of roles (the necessity of administrators)
>alignment as legitimacy in authorship; i.e. the ability to fix a relationship between a substitute and materials, the handling of licenses, the parallel progression of kids (with their ‘stable’ labels) and (the progression) of books (as something that is to be handled by kids through instruction).
-The administration of roles and the testing of systems (end of regional perspective)


Part 2

After part 1, in which I looked at how offline and online phenomena are co-evolving, I turn to the question of how I am to study the irreversibility of networks – the trail of strength. In Sørensen’s study the new technologies were placed resources. I also want to study the materiality of learning as placed resources, but wonder how they are placed in such a way that they perform good presence and separation. 
*Could I already here introduce ‘good surveillance’

The chapter looks at the professionalization of teaching and assesses the theory that the organization of algorithms leads to a form of bureaucratic recursiveness; how it reconstitutes the democratic subject around him/herself. Yet, it challenges the view that the algorithm, or rather the computer, is not also productive; it establishes new alliances across the networks of classrooms, computer-systems and the educational establishment (pedagogy, empiri and evaluation). 
**behavioralism and the personal(notes on conversation with Yannis).

At the same time as I move on from studying the students’ learning environment I also start looking at how questions of privacy rights are translated from the classroom into other local contexts. It is said that the computer system is not effected by the users, but how are questions of design also a politics of care, work, etc. 


Ch.3. The simultaneous internalization and externalization of ‘data’

-The office (ontology) and the computer; how does the computer change organizational relations
-- The SMART-board & local ‘cognition’ (what is smart) VS. Kahoot! & distributed cognition (a theoretical model)
>How does these technologies work as accounting devices, or carry responsibility? If I introduce these examples here I get straight onto how these questions are dealt with in the everyday practice of so called ‘Technology Enhanced Learning’ (TEL), or the high tech. 
+How does it fit with the idea of the teachers’ subjectivity/agency and the idea of getting beyond the (so called ANT) idea of one technology challenging the responsibility of an organization at large.
-We are then left with explaining how the school from an systemic perspective fascilitates these objects (through the cloud). 
-Both are so-called external-service objects that are fascilitated within it, becoming accountable to the administration. It is owned, and relations are cut off contractural installation. The SMART-board through wires, and the other through an API. 
*Perhaps I could compare these to ‘external’ objects with the two internal ones on my chart. The SMART-book (local) and Sokrates (non-local)

-The history of the LMS: a product of internet technologies rather than a technology in itself?
-The cloud and the update; forgetting
-The cloud vs social networks (memory practice in the cloud)


Ch.4. The national network within the local ‘design’
How not to separate between the documents in Ludvigsen utvalget and that of GDPR. These might well be different arenas of politics, but their boundaries should not at once be assumed.

-Ludvigsen utvalget is politicising the question of handling multiple sources for learning.
- accounting for learning designs in an ‘augmented reality’
>negotiating the semantic curriculum
- institutionalizing new search; the deep learning paradigm
- talking about the ‘meta’; teacher agency in the digital ecosystem

-The equivalence between Ludvigsen’s message and IKTsenteret’s work. 
-The issue of ownership/mandates among devices. 

*Following the four categories of metaphors: 1.the mobile/kahoot 2. the virtual/LMS  3.the digital/text-format  4.the database
-1.The success of a new mobile accounting device; agecement with an SMS
>The co-creating discipline for substitutes and presence with classes; accounting for the inside of the teaching context – formalized care and the necessity of having someone present.
-2.The weakness of a virtual classroom; the stability of the classroom and the mobility of people/groups – the necessity of ‘rooms’ to be organized, and the weakness of institutional data in friction with the de facto laws/ethics of the Internet (online). 
>The idea of perfect memory and the hidden work (informal care) of multiple teachers; in meetings the tracability of actions were negotiated, frontstage and backstage. 
-3.The digital book; the strength/fixity of the book must be seen as a form of legitimized use and authority – the book is unchanging, while the teachers adapt.
-4.The traces of a failed accounting system; transgressing boundaries and the legitimacy of access
>This dimension shows that the school also works to house ‘constructivist’(as opposed to objectivist) technologies/flow


Part 3 – The distributed intervention
Ch.5. The boundary institution and the LMS
-how semantic (dynamic) data orders accounting practice in the school system?
-’Mobile first’ as a policy platform – co-constructing ICT in education
-Constructing national boundaries in ubiquitous media



Ch.6. The post-human learner as the intervener?
-Separating learners and instruments in CCT
-how ideas about the biodigital child is changing measures of objectivity within pedagogy and education research.
