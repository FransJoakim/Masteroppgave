Test Title: Boundaries in the clouds and the shape of the education system: Microsoft Cloud Computing and the co-construction of 'personal information management' in the Norwegian education system


Intro.ch.:

This is my story of how I ventured into the culture of 'geeks', meant in a good way.. a travel into the naive. 
..I sit an listen to a representative from microsoft tell me about how to understand the new regulations of the cloud.. I learn about the new standard from the perspective of the software developers, represented (through their interestment) of the geeks, but also in a way an antagonist. 

This was a classic discussion about the application of open source technologies in the education system: the OER, the LMS etc.  --- and its failure
It had been studied by researchers like Lee, who found that these technolgoies of 'mass-individualization' was being used to promote a form of 'objectivist' learning. However, in a sense, this is simply a reverse argument of the failure of the open-source.

Yet, the spread of education technologies and learning service providors was not a failure. It was a question about how 'cloudification' is performed and the performance of 'openness' in the wider technopedagogic apparatus. 




**Learning about the internet**
I learned that much of the internet was built on open source software, and that it was entirely wrong to say that open source and free software had diminished in the face of intelectual property rights (IPRs); See Kelty's idea of fixity..

.. I was also very much interested in the shifting relationship between 'local' computing and 'remote' computing; PCs and servers.

When I started working on the thesis I was using a Chromebook, a notebook running google's own Chrome operating system called ChromeOS. Notebooks in general, but the ChromeOS in particular, is designed for webbrowsing activities. The Chromebook and Android systems might be defined as open source as they both 'build' on Linux. The Chromebook represented an intervention by Google into the Personal Computer landscape.. The tech giant was allying once more with the actors of the 'free software movement'. 


I then switched to full blown 'free software', the Linux based Ubuntu operating system. In the process of learning about the openness of the hybrid forums in which computing standards and expert cultures met... 


This was a struggle between the meaning of the 'mobile' (and the so-called affordance of the digital technologies), its agency within the propriatory spaces of the 'domestic', and its associations with the propriatary systems of the IT-giants. These issues were generally heavily regulated within the 'solutionist' paradigms of the digital economy... These controvercies were playing out in the court houses, legislative branches and realms of internet activism. Meanwhile a revolution was playing out in the distributed spaces that was the digital landscape. A controvercy that was not only not black-boxed, but was not only barely understood by the experts; it was highly political (seeing, as I hope, the role of experts in politics today)
**.. I was interested in the new efforts at the verge of a tech-breach in the AI revolution

My interest in cloudification emerged from:
-My interest in blockchain technology and the power distributed and decentralized organizations. Where did it come from, and what was its historical role?
>the powers of web2.0 giants to intervene into the ownership of our profiles in the post dot.com bubble era, and the reflexive actions taken in the blockchain landscape towards establishing new de facto standards for the handling and ownership of our online identities - the digital/second/shadow self. 
-The historical role of FinTech: I had already done the study of the LSP and the norwegian LMS.............................
>I tried to bring these ideas with me back into my studies of education technologies and I asked whats effects this had on the design process in education as a sector in which the production of the self is central.




**economization: how to look beyond descriptions of local adoption (From calculation to alienation: disentangling economic abstraction)**

In the span between Callon and Miller my theoretical question emerges:
(p.237) Can we in any productive way identify educational markets as generic social types within the digital economy, or its 'digitalization'?

+Reminds me of Law's (1992) discussion of the general findings in his notes on ANT theory - in addition to the "empirical conclusion that translation is contingent, local and variable". His 4th. and last finding is the 'issue of the scope of the ordering'. Despite having pressed the view that the process is local he argues also that it is possible to impute somewhat general *strategies of translation* to networks. Strategies which, like Foucauldian discourses, ramify through and reproduce themselves in a range of network instances or locations. He makes sure to point that the reader should "[n]ote that if these exist, they are more or less implicit- for explicit strategic calculation is only possible if there is already a center of translation"
Law's argument turns our attention to the organization. He writes that: 

*"What might such strategies look like? This, again, is an empirical matter. But since no ordering is ever complete, we might expect a series of strategies to coexist and interact. This, at any rate, is the claim made by several actor-network writers. Thus, in a recent study of management, I have detected a range of strategies - "enterprise," "administration," "vocation," and "vision" - which collectively operate to generate multi-strategic agents, organizational arrangements, and inter-organizational transactions. Indeed, the argument is that an organization may be seen as a set of such strategies which operate to generate complex configurations of network durability, spatial mobility, systems of representation, and calculability--configurations which have the effect of generating the center/periphery asymmetries and hierarchies characteristic of most formal organizations."*(p.388-389)

**This view both fits with Kelty's writings and my interests in institutional theory.



What did it mean to study such developments empirically? This was not a simple question. Not only did one have to try to apply the theoretical work of feminist writers in STS, like Polls, and be serious about how one studied the 'emergence' of issues. One also had to deal with efforts at studying the digital, described well by the model that shows the different way of approaching online and offline phenomena in the digital era. 

I saw some studies inspired by studies like Poll's looking at the local adaptation of mobile-technology systems like the GPS (in nursing) or other tracking systems; emphasising the study of accountability, but also imagination of perfect trackability. This was not as easy with cloud technologies. I wanted to study how a cloud was constructed and stabilized within a sector like education, because there were no good definition of the cloud. In light of the importance of these developments these were understudied objects. Indeed, while the GPS is an object with a relative coherent history and its use as a startingpoint in an investigation is relatively straight forward, the construction of new forms of 'de facto' standards of tracability in the cloud was defined by its controvercy, and the unability to define the object of study. 

Indeed, approaching the 'handling' of software-ecosystems within education I had to question what education was. Should it be understood through the offline phenomenon or the online phenomena. I wanted to study the power of education and the education system in the encounter with the so-called 'personal-computers' and the networks surrounding them. 

I could not forget about the controvercies in the macro. The history of the cloud could not be detached from the issues of personal information management. In the face of new giants like Facebook I did not want to construct an image of 'the corporate' as a single entity (material or analytical). I wanted to understand how the Microsoft system had agency in the schools encounter with the remote network. The application of remote networks in the governance of organizations was not just a matter of digitalization, it was an issue of the authority of the state and of the education apparatus. 

After some time I found out that I was not the only one trying to tackle this issue. It was a tendency of a new anthropological sensitivity in the study of information infrastructures. These studies were typified in the 'little tools' project at the TIK centre, which looked at the valuation work performed by some texts on others.
-I was interested in the use of a range of technologies in the local network and the consequences on a shared understanding of the purpose of education. 

There had in general been conducted few studies of the 'high tech sociology of education'.. Some looked at best practice, or tried to theorise how online learning environments changed educational notions like literacy, or classroom managment. Yet, there were very little separation between the study of the high tech and educational research in itself. As a STS researcher I knew that I had to look at how the effects of these devices were framed. 

The studies that were performed mainly pointed to the need of an critical approach, and almost exlusively theorized some part of how pedagogic-research is adapted to construction and promotion of educational technologies, or how schools adopt regulations to their own needs.

I was interested in the relationship between the texts that circulated in the bureaucracy of the school (represented by the internal network and its 'official spaces') and the texts circulating among students. Why were such interactions not more easily automated, causing such controvercy around time-management practices within the school? And why were the school system still so dependent upon text in its more traditional format, and not games, films, virtual-animation, or so much of the internet sites we visit? How did the school handle the boundary between the personal and the official in the education context.



**Method**

'Emergence' became such an important concept in my account of the Microsoft system. My starting point is the co-ordination of learning materials in the performance of harmonized standars of interoperability, within the measurment of learning and their accounting devices. The process of tranlating action into behavior, and the way memory work is performed within the paradigm of 'good surveillance', or 'good pedagogy' in education. 

Instead of asking how behavioral policy is implemented and enforced, I ask what legal rights are 'cared for' and how this changes the education system. How does the high tech give agency to teachers through their forms of accounting for learning.

Approaches in the literature: the role of ecosystem and the systemic account
-teacher agency in relation to learning design; trying to see the ecosystem. But where does these categories come from (Asdal).
-bringing knowledge objects into the classroom as a form of action theory; a theory that underestimates the relationship between infrastructure already installed in the classroom and the co-ordination work performed by the teacher to make such actions knowledgeble. 

In my multicited ethnography I try to follow the guaranties that are ensured by services in the cloud computing landscape. How does contracts with the school owner, and other authorities shape the way the students are cared for? 






....

Beginning with an emphasis on co-ordination establishes teachers as mediators in a larger complex, like the mediator in the group-interview setting (we could perhaps even say that it varies the extent to which the teacher wants to know something about the group's world view, and the extent to which they inform). As mediators they are responsible for the circulation of computers. With this firmly established in part one we get back to the point I discussed with the Greek professor; that the teacher co-ordinate different materialities of learning and how they are attached to students. You can for example see that the availability and circulation of materials have an effect on the 'de-centralized' character of the curiculum.








Part.1 Co-ordination
p.2'Negotiating between learning materials to build common *curiculums*'
-How are these curiculums enmeshed in the building of large information systems
-p.2Learning goals as 'intersubjective interpretation/mediation'
*Teachers as many: p.11 Teacher as interactive/intersubjective. Difference (between users) created in categorical system. Demanding one kind of (organizational) literacy - ignoring others. Critical infrastructure seen over by the teacher who *transcribe* open software into accounting system attached to user (translation is done by computing/typing - AI transcends).

Part.2 alignment - multiplicities in networks
*towards a de-centralized approach to curiculum-managment (L97>L06) - Constructing a 'learning analytics space'.
Epistemics: *hybrid communities* Different kinds of 'system' encounters. Curriculums seen in Kahoot, (behavior ordering)documents and other *instruments* FOR learning.
-Cybernetics as modeling (infrastructurement): shaping survailence or society?
>instead of observing negotiations of learning (as Star: CANT) we observe (post-human/Sørensen: emerging) spaces of imagination (Using Asdal to build on Suchman and Macknight).
