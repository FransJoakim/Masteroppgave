Tittle: A lifetime in the cloud: The study of boundareis in computer-networks, Actor Network-Theory, and educational (e)valuation.


The thesis is about the construction of an infrastructure for 'life-long learning' in the cloud. It follows cloud-computing as both a boundary object and an actor in the form of the Microsoft cloud-computing system Windows 365. 

I follow its intervention into the school system; what I define as autonomous organisations built up off teachers, students and the administration.

The administration is buying a new system for the management of learning (and/or pedagogic work), shift the relationship between the three groups.  



If I approach the study of schools like Latour approaches the laboratory or Callon approaches scallops then the circulation of children through the rooms of the school is to be explained through the study, and not understood as a precondition of a case of 'educational research'. 


*The learning comitee*


*The educational information technology organization*


*The school*
There are several spaces in the school-building. Especially significant is the division between the young people 'attending' school - participating in the circulation of groups of people their own 'age' through the so-called 'classrooms', hallways, play-grounds etc. - and those older wage laberours at the school and who alterate between 'supervising' this circulation of groups and materials and accounting for the supervision in office work. 

The office work almost exclusively happens in an area closed off from the children.. 
...

One could say that all of these are educational spaces, without it giving much sense in and off itself. The people that inhabit these spaces might well share an imaginary of what education implies, but it is most certainly a fluent concept. Like Latour I want to begin by trying to understand how 'education' happens inbetween these spaces. Especially the spaces of schooling and the spaces of administration. 

I want to construct an image of the imaginations of schooling within materialities of education. I follow writers like Estrid Sørensen in going beyond idea of learning materials (in educational settings), and flipping these concepts on their head. Analysing education settings through the lens of the materialities of learning. Sørensen's study has gained widespread attension within the academic circles using ANT inspired (socio-material or socio-cultural) approaches to educational research. When trying to move beyond the classroom I try to understand how these settings fascilitate pedagogic interactions with learning materials through a process of selection and ordering among these materials. This is an important conclution within Sørensen's study, but one that has mostly been overlooked. 
>perhaps understood as subject to the material standards that are 'typical' of education; such as text-book production. Yet, such an assumption would underestimate the uncertainty associated with the 'vibrancy' of these materialities. However, the application of ANT in educational research could be sayd to be a typical example of the theoretization of the framework; used to analyse the ... that provide stability in networks. 

Studying the domestication of the Internet breaks with such an idea of stability and brings back into out analysis an element of uncertainty. Interestingly, STS has a history with studying the application of new technologies in education, but these roots seem unknown to most continental researchers. 






Trying to theorize the relationship between education and science is an important part of my effort to develop Francis Lee's idea of 'technopedagogy' as a concept moduled on the idea of 'technoscience'. Like in Latour and Wolgar's account of 'laboratory life' these spaces are differentiated from the peatry dishes that make up the objects of study. I follow Latour and Wolgar in trying to understand the products of practices in the institution by virtue of the circulation of people and materials between these spaces and not simply as products of what happens in the spaces and practices inside the technical installations that make up the laboratory and the classroom. That is what is reffered to outside the 'walls' of the organisation as one accounts for an event. 

However, as opposed to the idea of the peatry dish the idea of groups of people in classrooms more readily associate with the 'social' work of the teacher. While the 'trick' to following the scientists around the laberatory (and beyond) was to unravel the social work 'hidden' in the process of making 'hard science' one must use different measures to accout for the (so-called) subjectivity of the teacher in the performance of education. 
Like in science, much of the difficulty with studying education is to describe the boundary work that goes into controlling the associations between the individuals being educated (or observing the experiment) and nature; be that the nature of language, society or 'N'ature. Yet, while much of the work of conditioning the technical set-up in the laboratory was associated with establishing 'similarities' between the materials being 'tested' by accounting for relationships among the (knowledge) objects that are said to cause an order of phenomena, such ordering in the classroom happens through the circulation of 'different' objects. I try to figure out how such difference is associated with the teacher, or what I choose to think of as the teacher's agency.

Similarity and difference is in many ways two sides of the same coin; a result of a form of accounting within a chategory-system. Similarly, Education is also intimately tied to science. Yet, While in 'science' each discipline (more or less) disregard the multiplicity of truths within the range of sciences, educators take careful account of the differences between the subjects and the way subjectivity is performed. Moreover, while science could be sayd to differentiate within what is understood (controlled) as similar conditions - incorporating what can be extreme varieties within the theoretical frameworks of everything that is similar - education could perhaps be sayd to do the reverse. It simulates differences within what is understood as a natural (controlled) setting. 
*This points to how Sørensen also could say that the materiality of learning is related to the act of carrying meaning accross (similar) spaces.

Latour and Wolgar had to try to get to grips with the circulation (dialectics) of objects between the 'controlled' (but messy) conditions of the laboratory and the 'uncontrolable' (but regulated and/or culturally imbowed) conditions of the textual dialectics of scientific writing and publishing. I, on the other hand, try to grapple with the way the uncontrollable conditions of the 'text-book-in-the-making' is re-established within the classroom. 

Some examples of the consequence of such an 'enactment of teaching'(/learning):
-In the classroom 'search' was mostely enacted without a computer at hand. The computer was mostly taken out when the class was meant to seem productive (and self-regulating). The teacher, is with the group as they read the book or read information online. This ability to be with one's pupils as they interact with materils is an essential part of the history of the modern university. 

-In the science room (an add-on to the regulated opinion-mediation of the classroom) it is the mess of the process of organising groups around the microscope that required the intervention of screeming (or loud talk). The failure to intervene with models, meant to be displayied on the 3D-projector taken out from behind glass doors at the side of the classroom, went unnoticed. These modelles were supposed to re-create the differences within the systems theories of (in this example) cellular-cybernetics. The latter could both be understood as a failure within the organisation to install the software to display 3D-models and as a failure of the teacher to open the glass-doors. Yet, the students only seemed to encounter these forms of responsibility within the practices of enacting the process of doing research themselves. 
 
**the point being that educators need to supervise the circulation of learning objects. Learning materials parttake in this process. Books are for example said (in ANT accounts of education) to help assure the teacher that everyone is 'at the same place', however one could go so far as to say that these objects enact a sort of circulation around students. We imagine scientists going out into nature, gathering exotic objects to bring back to their laboratories. Scientists could be said to influence what they study as they pick the objects to bring back. This is the phenomenon that is described through the making of 'immutable mobiles'. The educator on the other hand has recreated the classroom in schools around the world. The children circulate through these spaces, but we also know that the objects that makes it appear so as if the children are stationary and the world's objects is circulating through them has to be 'mutable mobiles'. 
**Moreover though, this relationship is also seen in the subjectivity accounted for in the pupils. While the scientists minimise their own presence, the presence of students are maximised. 









The young people are typically (within the school and outside) refered to as 'elever', or 'pupils' in English, though the term could also be translated into 'students'. While the term 'student' in Norway is normally reserved to older individuals at higher-educational institutions one rarely refer to pupils as children at the secondary school-level. The distinct Norwegian term 'ungdom' is used, refering to the early (to middel) period of adolecence and the term 'youth'. The name 'ungdomsskolen' (adolecence/youth-school) also distinguish the organisation as part of the institutional apparatus at the secondary level in the progression of educational institutions within the wider 'system' of human upbringing.

I sometimes refer to these people as children as the associations most easily distinguishes the group as 'others' in relation to the wage labourers and/or bureaucrats. While it is a heavily cultural imbowed term that might be difficult to 'handle' outside of the context I apply the label with an awareness of some of its benifits. In adition to pointing out some of the power-assymetry between the two groups the term also helps to point out the fact that the institution gain some of its legitimacy by cutting off relations between itself and the rest of society for the duration of the so called 'school-day'. That is, between 08:30 and 14:00. The history of modern education cannot, as Niels Christie points out, be cut off from the history of the wage labour and the fact that between these hours their 'parrents' should be able to concern themselves with other affairs elsewhere. 

Since these are the conditions that I also hope to apply to the theoretization of the politics of education technology I nevertheless mostly refer to the group of children as students. This way I hope to emphasise the importance given to the autonomy of these people as individuals and the ideal of self-regulation. This is a central element within Foucauld's account of the possitive power of education as a disciplinary institution and of the biopolitical condition of 'technologies of the self'. And, moreover, it is adopted within post-foucauldian analysis of the wider education system, or what Francis Lee (timedly) calls 'technopedagogy'. Lee has tried to develop an analysis of the information infrastructure that makes it possible to perform a pedagogical assessment across distance. I am inspired by Lee's attempt to draw comparisons between the construction of technological standards for education online in the 21st century and the infrastructure that made distance-education possible through the postal excange of letters in the 19th century. 

While there have been much 'hype' around the possibility for online educational resources to reach the massess (inside as well as outside educational programs) distance-education also continues today.. 
>how it is integrated into education is an important question.


It is my goals to describe how the relationship is constructed between imaginaries of these groups as children, and as protected and enclosed, and as students, and self-regulating and exposed (to representations of the world) by virtue of their circulation accross the boundaries of the institution. The contribution that my ANT approach to the study of education hopefully will make is to look at the boundary work performed by a further (and, as far as I can tell, understudied) division in the school; that between the office the administration. 

Doing this the theoretical aim is to study the fascilitation of computers as 'risky objects' in classrooms. 
-As far as I can tell the administration of schools is an understudied group.

I try to study how they regulate networks within the school; the relationships between 








In my analysis the administration intervenes into the computer network and problematizes the way that the management of groups are performed..
