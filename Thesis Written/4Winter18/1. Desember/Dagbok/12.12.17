I have reasently moved into an appartment in which a large secondary school is located right accross the street from us. Each morning I am confronted with the view of groups of young students attentively facing whiteboards behind the large windows. The fact that it is a 'performance' has become almost overwelmingly clear to me as I slumber through my morning rituals. The organisation of these large groups of people, young and old, is impressive.  

There is an irony to the experince of watching teachers my own age turn the lights on and lead these groups into 'action'. I am supposed to study the teachers' habit, but I most certainly one among the students at large.

It would not be too far fetched to think that I perhaps could have used my educational identity profile to log onto the school network, and study the information infrastructure in their 'cloud' up close (so to say). Off course, I cannot. Because although my identity credentials are logged within the same student registers as the secondary school students accross the steet the common identity we share pertain only to 'education system' at large. Not the organisation housed accross the street, and not the basic (elementary and secondary) educational institution that this organisation could be said to represent. 

Our identity profiles share a common database nationally. A database known as Felles studentsystem (FS), or 'The Common Student System'. Yet, these city streets, as well as servers up the street at the University of Oslo, are testiment to how differently infrastructure could shape our lives. We live in different spheres of the world of education. Yet, I question how separate they - or we (including the academic audience) - are..

To use their network
-the challenge of logging in has shaped my studies.. ..what would I have insight into inside the municipality and not..? 


My interest is with the importance of the administrators that makes the infrastructure run. In fact, in the momement of writing I am watching an IT-administrator of some kind gathering up some PCs, runing what looks like some kind of update. Unusual in terms of the mobile technologies that I have seen fascilitate these updates on a regular basis (and which plays such an important part in my study), but nontheless a 'typical' esthetic, characteristic of 'ICT in education'; laptops stacked in a corner in small room at the corner of the building, and a young male, ID-badge necklace hanging out of the backpoket of his jeans. 


If the teacher could be studied as an administrator of the same kind, and not as a different expert culture altogether, then the flow of people structure our lives so differently could be examined. Indeed I make quite and effort to try to appreciate the way these expert cultures interact, inside as well as outside these institutions. But, these flows are also fascilitated by standards etc. in the infrastructure. 

..Nils Christie book 'Hvis skolen ikke fantes' (If schools didn't exist) argues the significance of seeing the classroom within the historical context of capitalist production, and the effort to storing kids whilst their parrents are at work. An institution without much of a mission at all, one could think. Such a view goes countrary to much of the experience of being with teachers. Out of personal experience I could say that the profesion feels very busy. 

Christies argument also fits well with the idea of technological determinism as a leading component of educational political thought. We could say that the school co-fasciliates kids and computers, but such a view would distinguish exesively between computers and other learning materials. The trick is to study these materials, as well as 'the social', symetrically. 

-We could say that the school hosts an open internet, next to their cloud-based systems. As such the kids are stored along with the learning materials. The internal assosiations between these human and non-human elements could seem quite irrelevant as long as both the devices and humans seem to be 'working', but what this argument shows is how accounting measures are left to the actors.
-What binds these materials into internal networks, and how does it shape relations across the wider sector?
