The ethics of equity standards: problems and ambitions
-'Good survaillance' and valuation in the governments digitalization strategy
-The marked ideology of openness in computer history: Is 


	-the law and the construction of a new impartial ethics
-GDPR, the rights of the digital citizen and policy standards; enacting local universality
-Security, the uquiquity of data, and different forms of risk

Life-long learning and the boundaries of the education system
-Studying irreversibility in the extension of the network
-The social life of 'data' in public-infrastructures: integrating 'digital-knowledge' in the state
-Developing a pragmatic approach to accountability


I also briefly introduce the contexts:

-Bergnes secondary school and municipality
	-How I treat access and anonymity methodologically
	-IT-department that cares for the integration of several institutional infrastructures
	-New ICT-policy that distinguishes the world of ICT in education
	-The school region: shared networks fascilitating diverse expert communities

-The Learning Committee and the Norwegian standardization body
	-Standards Norway and the fascilitation of a political microcosme within Norwegian education.
	-The International Standardization Organisation (ISO) and the transnational negotiations.
	-The Norwegian Directorate of Education and Training's (UDIR) merger with The Norwegian Centre for ICT in Education.
	-The learning analytics pilote project in the Oslo school region and the agacement of Feide.
	-Questions of 'good' adoptation and security policy.

-Uninett and Norway's research and education network
	-The meeting: Experience and negotiation, impartiality, and interoperability in the Higher Education (HE) sector.
	-Building the infrastructure for the commercial internet, whilst 'testing' technical standards in their own infrastructure.
	-Governance and associations with the government: the reform and the transition to political experties
	-GDPR; translating the entire national student population into a virtual learning environment infrastructure
	-fascilitating 'self-regulating' security management systems


	



	

The **methodology** chapter:

Studying infrastructure
-Infrastructure as context(s)
-Infrastructure in flux: from rooms to learning environments
-reflexive standardization: accountability and the production of the unknown
-Chategorization: from self-identification to the nomenculture of decises(sykdom)

Boundaries in life-long learning infrastructure
-Feide as a 'boundary object': Accountability and autonomy among systems
-The LMS as a hybrid forum and a hybrid object
-Non-agreement and world-making
-Caring for learning publics in Norway: pedagogic policy, pedagogic industry and pedagogic science

Studying interventions in the cloud
-Naivity and cloud technology
-Infrastructuring internet services; parralell survaillence regimes in private, work and education environments online. 
-Access and portals in the cloud: alignment and the dynamic co-ordination of automated partern recognition sofware
-Being specific about algorithms: profiles and profiling systems on- and offline.




Ch.1: Constructing semantic self-regulation: Problematizing the learning body inside the educational institution

This chapter studies the infrastructure of goal-oriented learning design in a secondary school. It looks at how different forms of education technology co-exist, how they are separated and regionalized.

-Handling digital and non-digitial text-books: the 'negative' power of the authentification token.
	-The co-existance of private and public devices in the digital classroom
		-The science class: externalizing cybernetics. The cell-body on display and the exclusion of the computer.
		-The language classes: externalizing the observer, the newspaper and the enactment of a search.
	-Controlling goal performance: the token associates the roster and the 'learning-plan'.
		-the learning plan as 'old' infrastructure.
		-the discipline of platform technologies like Visma (attendance and behavior as functionary adoptions).
	-Handling teachers, schedules, and subject-spaces.
		-the teacher multiple: the subjective position of the substitute-teacher
		-recreating divergence among special-educational and subject-oriented staff.
-The enclave of childhood and the (supposedly) enclosed space of the referential learner
	-Christie: the institutionalization of a public repository (storage and chatalogues of competent individuals)
	-Talking about the digital as knowledge object vs. information infrastructure
		-The science class
		-The language class
-Overflow and communal presence in 'public' education
	-Discipline and communal presence in the building
	-Democracy in the game and in the book: fascilitating groups of self-regulated learners
-the self-regulating individual is supposed to be part of an infrastructure of privacy measures. These are however performed.
	-Personal presence in the hallway


Ch.2: 

The regional network is being re-oriented around the ecosystem model (that administrators and pedagogic representatives were enrolled into when uninet chapter was ch.2)

-The political technology: enacting a 'national' forum
-Envisioning openness in education; the representation of basic education.
-Fasciliting national negotiations in the education 'ecosystem'.
-The self-regulating school: re-assembling the autonomous professional

The regional-national boundary:
-Objectivity is understood in terms of networks which have a sort of centre-periphery relationship built into it


Ch.3: 

Looks at the re-assembly of the regional network within the ecosystem-model: What does care for sementic-data mean? How is it performed?

Care-persons are interested in the administrative role, which comes about when data is stored.

Objectivity is performed when the division between the LMS and LRS becomes the division between behavioral and activty data. Activity data allows for the survaillence of behavior like clicks.
