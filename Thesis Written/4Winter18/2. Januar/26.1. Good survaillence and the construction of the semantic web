**The materiality of teaching; 'good survaillence' in the age of artificial intelligence**


In my thesis I look at the handling of risk in educational survaillence technologies and the ordering of human and non-human survaillence mechanisms. I investigate a emerging survaillence paradigm in Norwegian education through an ethnographic study of a secondary school, and two hybrid forums of pedagogic, programing and political experties. I use a grounded approach to how one survaillance technology standard, the Feide authentification portal, is shaping the relationship between children and adults and how care practices are performed (through human and non-human means). 

I ask how mechanical (i.e. digital) observation systems are mediating the relationship between learners, teachers and administrators, as well as how the same process co-modifies these emerging digital survaillance systems (negotiating boarders between the local, national and transnational within). 

As you know the study is based on an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) appraoch. I look at the translation of the technology in the educational reform and the 'next-generation' Norwegian educational authentification standard feide 2.0. 

I follow the standard through three contexts; the secondary school, the educational administration forum at the Uninett 2017 conference, and the political forum hosted by Standard Norway and the The Norwegian Centre for ICT in Education called læringskomiteen, or the 'learning committee'.

I found the authentification standard to be fundamental in the formation of the boundaries national-public digitalization project and the construction of openness in education. I aim to show how boundaries are drawn between openness in the public digital realm and in education. 
My interest lies with the *convergence* of an educational and a social media ontology.





In chapter one I look at the ontology of the Personal Computer (PC) and the hybrid objects that emerge out of the tension between 'de facto' standard of windows and local policy practice. In this context accountability is performed through practices of 'being with', conversation, and personal goals.

In chapter two I look at the ontology of the semantic web and the ambitions of a 'de jure' standard in digital education governance and learning analytics. In this context accountability is performed through measures of semantic analytics, activity data, progression goals.

In chapter three I explore the tension between the two standards and how the authentification standard intervenes into the boundary between the national and the local; the cloud platform that mediates how, when and why computers are intervened into at a distance, and the national community of teachers and the local community of administrators. In this context accountability is performed through information security and containarization.





(Microsoft) Windows 365, cloud-based ecosystem into a 'Windows metaphor' in the governance of educational institutions and the legal, political and economic technologies of the state.  

want to look at the construction of educational-semantic-data as boundary object. I investigate the current move in Norwegian digital educational governance to construct a triangle-model of education in the cloud; aligning, coordinating and separating forms of care. The triangle includes the learning record store, learning management system and the learning tools interoperability standard. 

The Norwegian government is investing a great deal of resources in insuring that Norwegian Educational Technology (EdTech) will become highly valued in this rapedly expanding field of global public investment in the years to come. Together with the Chinese and Canadian government the Norwegian authorities are developing a semiotic learning model that is projecting these two countries towards becoming world leaders in the technological monetization of learning-goal achievement. The Norwegian-Chinese-Canadian standard is engaging in competition with standards backed by consortiums of other global powers, like the governments of the United States (US), France, and ..(?). 

The thesis is about the agency, or power, that these socio-technical standards in Education excert. The idea of a repository of activity and their associated credentials far outdates cloud computing. It has probably been around for as long as the modern education system, but have gained new importance in the 'digitalization' process within public administration and governance. I study how a new form of governance is emerging in the education cloud where the 'biodigital child' is constructed and I ask how 'good survaillance' is performed within the development of an learning analytic standard in Norwegian education. Instead of comparing their influence in qualitative measures of size I look at its 'meaning' within communities of experties in Norway and how the materiality of the infrastructure that makes up the standard is associated with the politics, science and (not least) the organization of pedagogic work. 

More specifically I look at the construction of the 'next-generation' Norwegian educational authentification standard feide 2.0. and I follow the standard through three contexts; the secondary school, the educational administration forum at the Uninett 2017 conference, and the political forum hosted by Standard Norway and the The Norwegian Centre for ICT in Education called læringskomiteen, or the 'learning committee'. 

I show how separation is performed between different forms of learning materialities, and how agency comes about in educational-semantic-data in the work of re-assembling the biodigital child. Lastly I look at the way the unintended side-effects of separation performed in the standard is being handled, and how the boundary work is causing the reconfiguration of the educational landscape.





**The construction of 'free' information**

When creating a standard for accounting for 'openness' in Norway the authentification system Feide has been essential. The associations of information with textbooks, has been dominant and efforts to counter their power has in many ways been modeled on the internet. The computer has been an object that have bridged these two forms of boundary objects. The computer 'laboratory' represented a space that was in opposition with the textbook, but when the laptop was introduced into the classroom and was asked to do classroom-work it did not automatically establish a hybrid space. 

When I arrived at the school the space of text-book filled the screens on the students' computers as well as the whiteboard. This did have its effect. It created a preliminary space for interaction, but a space in which the teacher administered. At the same time, the school was also filled with other kinds of computers, like smart-phones. These represented the kind of space that the teacher could not administer, and throughout the period in which I performed my ethnography I saw these devices both being welcomed and excluded from the classroom as place. 

The idea that all these interactions between students, teachers and computers could be standardized in a learning record store was both problamatic and controvercial. In my first empirical chapter I therefore look at how the standardized spaces of the computer and the distinct spaces of the subject-textbook is assembled and accounted for in the classroom through the care of the teacher and the evaluation work. I look at how the inclusion of internet-based knowledge objects in the classroom has excluded other cloud-based forms of subject-specific resources, such as subject-specific games or subject-specific databases. I however also show how a cloud-space exists apart from the subject-specific materiality of the classroom and the learning recpository.

In chapter two I look at how the work of administrating databases of textual and digital knowledge (video, statistics, animation etc.) is being done in the wider education system. The alignment of learning repositories with the students who produce them is not unproblematic. I find that the authentification schema that 






Lately I have been inspired by Thommas Måløy's masterthesis 'Building a virtual lifeform: Maps, Model organisms and Collaboration in Digital Biology'. Måløy writes about the performance of open science and how it is a vital component of the digital lifeform. By studying the organization of a digital model, science collaboration and an experimental culture he was able to ask 'what is a virtual lifeform?', how is it constructed and how is the digital translated into biology.

I want to look at the construction of a 'learning record store' as a repository of activity and their associated credentials. I ask how this form of accounting device allows for the cooperation among students, teachers and administrators.
