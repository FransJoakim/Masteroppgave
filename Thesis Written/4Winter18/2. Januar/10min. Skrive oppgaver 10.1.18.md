*What is your research question?*

I ask how the education system is working to integrate cloud-computing technologies into its accounting practices. 


*What are accounting practices?*

Accounting practices provide the basis for a measurement and chategorization system. They are often thought of as economic, but what is the economic realm really? The economy of education is largely unknown I think? There is certainly challenges in studying the economy of education. The role of IT is therefore a hard question to anskwer. It should have some economic role, and it is quite easy to point out its associations with the effectivisation of mass-production, or re-use, of learning materials. 

So when teachers are trying to adopt the measuring systems that have worked in a non-digital school system to the cloud-based platforms that are supposed to house the measurements they are running ashore. The computers that are supposed to mediate the interaction are not socially 'neutral'. The act of mediating a class or organizing a school is dependent on securing care through the separation of opinions and facts.

*Who are your actors?*

The actors are:
-the Microsoft system, which in my case is represented/ing by/off the municipality
-Feide, which is represented by the administration and the norms of the wider education system
-And classes, represented by an adult among a group of kids. 

The Microsoft system is translated into the cloud, meaning that the cloud-technologies from a backdrop.

*What are they doing?*

The Microsoft system is being 'updated'. Meaning that while it is new, it also remains the same somehow. It runs 'on' the same machines as before, but is also suplemented by machines that are better designed for the purpose of use in the system. So the minicipality buy licences for use among teachers and students. These licences are attached to the computers that the municipality own. 

Yet, the data that is processed is not owned. It is the product of 'work' among teachers and students. 


**15:15-40**

*Why does the Microsoft 'actor' has to be recognized as a system?*

The Microsoft clientell is the network that together with the company and the PC manifacturars and ventors form a network. The municipality that bought the system only had to choose an 'ecosystem'. The teachers and administration then has to adapt. I have for example been concerned with how the administration has baught technologies in which the organisation forms the basis for interactive practices. 

If I changed my idea of the actors I could say that there are several instances of government:
- the municipality, concerned with harmoneous infrastructure accross i.e. health and education..
- UDIR & IKTsenteret, representing those concerned with the quality of content and the laws of evaluation practices. 
- UNINETT, representing 'Kunnskapsdepartementet'.

Microsoft then is showing how the others should work with security concerns. The system update does more than only provide a new way of saving online.

*What does it have to do with Callon's model and account of 'the sociology of translation'?*

In Callon's work there are several steps which he describes as elements in the process of translation. Before the holiday I shaped a gread deal of my ideas in accordance with this way of understanding problematization. What is problematized in the process of cloudification? Lets think about the scallops for a second. They were said to be disappearing from the bay. So the scientists came and proposed a solution in which they translated a system from Japan into the waters of the French coast. They got representatives of the fishermen on board, as well as representatives from the local scallops, and they had a meeting. 

Now in the school that I am observing the one-to-one policy is said (at least by me) to solve an issue with the LMS. The LMS is not individualized, but it is rather treated as an 'administrative system'. Everyone has been approaching the local network as a form of website, yet few think of it as a social media... right.. 

How the system will do interestment in the mass-individualization of pedagogic work is really the key question right now. Mass-individualization is a very much a topic of the legal-economic approach of the school. What the students do on their computers and how it is stored is bound up with questions of privacy and survaillence; GDPR in short. 

The microsoft system was giving students a legitimate way of storing/sharing they notes, meaning that they were stored in the system that had to last. It intervenes into an issue in which teachers were having to be disciplined into avoiding certain channels of communication. It would work as a distribution channel. 
Moreover, it gave the administration a way of standardizing the frontstage.

*what is being co-ordinated at the school?*

It is the flow of people. Many of the learning materials are quite stationary, or at least particular to some subject-spaces. So, as I have written about in Desember and which I throught to put already in the introduction, I am asking how to deal with the idea within the framework of the schedule. Within my personal theoretical framework co-ordination is subject to the forces within alignment. So I want to show early on that the work of individualizing tasks is being done through the delivery systems that also is in tension with the work of creating 'understanding by design', aka the curriculum. 

I understand the curriculum in large part through the tyranny of the textbook. It is said to be forgotten in public discussions about school reform. In the introduction to this book the curriculum is defined as as "the teaching, learning, and assessment actvivites and materials that are organized and available to teach a given subject area. In other words, curriculum is the substance of what is taught."(xi) 

Two things makes me take more interest in Jobrack's account. For one this is also what has been recognized as being 'different' in Norway. Second, and more important, is the light it sheds on my research interests;
*how (on/with what) is curriculum delivered?*
