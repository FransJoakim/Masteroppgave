**Chapter 3 - Representing integrated school regions in the Learning Committee**
*by regions I mean spaces of the school, areas of experties, as well as the integration of the school infrastructure with that of the school region. While the schools physical infrastructure has to be characterized as their own version of a municipality infrastructure design, the school region is an area of (political) experties.*




Ch.2.
Here I present the government and industry imagination of the new governance regime. It is in many ways an imagination of a perfect surrvaillence regime based on a semantic-data technique. However, they negotiate new forms of accountability in which the meaning of data-processing responsible is unclear. 

In the learning committee the ethics of interoperability is discussed alot, as well as forms of governmentality, or the power of the government in the scales of the national edtech landscape.
-I problematize the way that governments in the last few decades have minimized teacher agency by imagining that the digitalization of (text based) learning goals (curriculums) would translate easily into the digital platforms of schools; and consequently work as a form of 'flexibile standardization' within the work of developing learning/teaching plans. 

I look at how they are translating these efforts into a digital ontology and adopting a semantic structure.

I explain the flexibile standardization efforts through the containarization of the 'app'-
-Sokrates is problematized as being an app and the issue of (standardized) unawareness is raised. 

In this way I am brought back to the issue of studying flow and software as permeable boundaries and as spatiality.
-When Sokrates is trying to automate much of the flow of learning materials awareness/unawerness within the organisation is problematized. I have a closer look at how authority is linked with the subjectivity of the student (s√∏rensen) and expand upon the translation work that teachers do as they observe and transcribe behavioral indicators. This is what I think of as the coordination and meaning of the personal vs. social/group.

I explain what it means to be 'critical' towards the coordination of the pedagogic study and the way that the temporality of the organization shifted. Working as a functionary it was no easy task to adopt to the simultaneity of co-ordinated efforts at individualization as a the whole organization shifted towards a different temporality and the responsiblity/growth of the kids were enacted. 

I tried to investigate this (imagined) form/ontology of digitalized pedagogy I talked to a few teachers (David, Frode..) who were credited with having been using advanced digital mechanisms. This boiled down to the accounting practice known as 'reverse learning', and their efforts at standardizing the ordering/esthetics/delivery of communication platforms. However, the communication platforms (and by extension the pedagogy) was not intrinsically different. All of the 'authors' of these standards even denied their own role in the expansion of such a culture (the culture was becoming problematized).

The computer is emerging as framework (to objectivity) within my study. I try to handle the materiality of the empirical material online; what does the platform (fixed and contain) got to do with the vimeo/youtube conference videos I am watching?
-I become critical to the distinction between social-media and the rest of the platform-economy in the digital 'ecology' and its economization (translation into education). 
-When I become aware of the centrality of 'learning analytics' my study develops in the direction of my talk with UCIT and political 'engagement/participation'.

I expand upon the idea of mass-individualization and the ontology of 'teaching clowds'. This is my intervention into the classical/historical field of curriculam ethics and the dynamics of processes of industrialized individualization vs. understanding/instruction (by) design.
-How could I look differently at the 'ethics of the school'?
-What does the Norwegian form of public openness matter?
-What does it matter that the democracy of the local is performed differently in the objective witnessing of the science class and the constructivist participation of the language classes?
-What does it matter that the division is problematized among the teachers and teacher seminar-leaders? How could such forms of representation (scale) be observed in the learning committee forum?

I am critical towards the idea of 'wearable augmentation' and expand upon the role of the authentification system in processes of alignment. 
-This is the meaning of the semantic and the subjectivity of the teacher-multiple



I ask how is alignment done within this form of coordination; how is the internet (institutions like search) made into local instruments brought 'into the classroom'?
-I conversily also consider the possibility that it is not brought in but is just displayed behind glass.

While teachers have been conserned with a form of objectivity in which they learn about the theorization of different 'materialities of learning', such as objectivity and constructivism, the effort to survaille more of the activities of the children through their 'profile', is materializing in a turn towards activity theory and an emphais on being with the technology - an ontological approach to the post-human.

The ontological approach (I see) is associated with the politics of professionalization; the effort at seeing algorithmic/dynamic search as 'operational'. I relate this to the externalization of services within the municipality-region. 

Morten talks about their need of life-long data and the imagination of the expanding network (emerging from below)











**Critical perspectives on the wearable augmentation approach**


**Twitch: Chategory systems and the strength of a platform**
-Sharing culture and communicating the openess strategy (to the teachers)


**Accounting devices and trails of strength (The competition)**
Teachers do compete for the experience, and how experience should count towards accounting for competence is a controvercial issue (see news article). Professionalisation happens as much through the exclusion of groups as through associations with competence and areas of responsibility. 

One controversy that is significant is the presence that administrators have with teachers. I saw that the administration was critisized for not asking about the personal life of the teachers, but focusing on standardized goals such as the use of digital tools. 

One could ask whether this controvercy within the ethics of educational governance was due to infrastructure being in flux. I certainly saw a strengthening of divisions in responsibility as new infrastructure was put in place by an 'administrative supervisor' who intervened into the relationship between teachers and their substitutes (what could be thought of as a personal relationship).
