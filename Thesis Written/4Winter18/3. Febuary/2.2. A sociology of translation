**The return of the deamon: Good surveillance in the life-long learning infrastructure of semantic education in Norway**


This thesis studies the materiality and co-modification of Windows 365. It does so because of what it might tell us about the ethics of survaillence and its politics.


Translation of ontology: historiography, bioeconomics, generalization and generalizability.

By first looking at the local perspective and then my own I argue that I can take a critical approach to whether government would want the 'perfect survaillance system' (Singelton), and re-historizise the cybernetic dream.

Action theory is advocated as a study of the historiography of the object being brought into the classroom, meant to establish an historiography among student groups, but it does not account for the historiography of the research itself'. This is important because this study of historisity in the classroom will be developed in the next chapters: In ch.2. the historic authority of the teacher is studied and theorized as an epistemology of 'ontological processes'. In ch.3 I develop on my own reflexive work, and argue that I need to study educational research as both sociological and as an act of muting/hiding the social. In ch.4 I then look at how the living and vibrant materiality of the post-human perspective on learning is mobilized through the re-production of the social (and rejection by automation) and the politization of the bioeconomic. This way I also show how formalization, or de-historization, becomes re-historisized (renewed historiography; from me, us and them) through the boundary work of securitization. This way I position myself as critical towards the post-cronological approach to information-infrastructure (support Ribbes instead of Bowker).


*Historiography*_ A intermediary object within the continuous and systemness of problematization efforts. I theorize, the epistemology of the students' own ontology. 'I do a historiography of their historiography (the local) among students doing historiography'.. Because I work on the totality of the epistemological approach in pedagogy and try to percieve how scale is enacted by reference to the kernel in the cloud; such as the subjectification and abstraction in the phenomenology of the epistemic. More rules of abstraction through algorithms is associated with further subjectification.


*Bioeconomics*_ 'How the biological study of learning is economized' I apply my theoretical apparatus to observe how accounting practices are shaped through the care practices; I am inspired by Lemke and try to go beyond the study of care. I argue that it is not in conflict with Law (2008). The development of boundaries of a massive public institution opens a space for a bioeconomics and a new morality of Law. I understand bioeconomics in light of the professionalization of epistemic practice in pedagogic work; the standardization of equity and the translation of the personal in relation to "ontological" technologies is itself doing 'estrangement' (weakness) and appealing to an other.


*Generalization*_ 'Playing on the concept of an experimental system and how boundaries can be shaped by an scientific endevor'. A new politics of experties is negotiated and a model is formulated within which enrolement and rejection is happening. The moral of education as life-long learning ('dannelse' becomes 'oppl√¶ring'). By ordering studies that orders (shapes and divides) responsibility agecement is enacted in relation to a law that have not yet been implemented. I expore this as a transnational aspect (China, Norway relations) and the translation of bioeconomics as power politics. 


*Generalizability*_ The political objective is performed as necessity and historisity lies with the tech giant. The externalization of both learning and data as through a from of reflexive transparency. The atonomy of the computer and the mutability of the administrative functionary as a co-creation of the distributed daemons; the muting and mutation of openness in recursive public. I don't longer know whether I belive the expert as he says he has tested the function. Has he tested the 'data' production process. Can it be tested or is it closed off. Telling the story of the recursive public by systematically considering the histiography of the movement, beyond the generalization of the 'move'. 





This thesis explores the pedagogy of cloudification and the translation a cloud-market into the local digital landscape of pedagogic practice in Windows 365.

I explore the idea of the construction of weakness in a different manner. One in which the weakness of an ICT standard itself is subject to problematization, interestement, enrollment and mobilization. The study shows how ubiquitous media in the cloud remain both material and immaterial, imutable and mutable and how decentralizized governance mechanisms only partially can handle these distributed systems.


What are the elements of the negotiations that I follow?

-The log-in system becoming an authentification portal to the Internet that automates administrative tasks.

-Very little being known about the automation of mechanisms of feedback in the subjectification of learning in the virtual learning environment.

-Education governance in the Bergnes secondary school coming under public scrutiny as it grapples with the local adoption of the political reform of 2006. 



*Problematization*
Who got agency to change education technology? The construction of the student body.. 
 

*Interestment*

*Enrolement*
The political process

*Mobilization*
