Revisiting the biodigital Kate O'Riordan - digital culture - sussex

How is the common good constructed and/OR enacted in the making of infrastructure. Extraction as movement, as it moves stuff, exstracts without leaving anything behing. Extraction as a mode of interactivity (mediated).

The biodigital. What work does it do? Puts mediation centre, and its intsified mediation, and the engagement of audiences. The receprical nature of media infrastrucutre. Combining the infinately replical and the exhaustive. 

Has used thrifts and luciano theresy discussion/critique on the biodigital. 

Biodigital as an already existing infrastrucutre that corporealizes infomration and makes materials informatics whilst temporarily stabilizing (informed material) movements. Temporary stabilizations offer forms of address, gathering publics and offering identities - how they are taken up, captured or moved on - makes a difference to both the present and the future. 

What are the ways we could think about collective investements? Is the public good also goods that is capitalized on? As long as part of the good is in the address - who and how - it is also that which becomes capitalized on. The 'bio' part of biodigital could be some form of break on the use outside of health in a sense. Is it the discourse which is stabilized or the technical? Well they are the same, as a movement happens towards a domain of research.
