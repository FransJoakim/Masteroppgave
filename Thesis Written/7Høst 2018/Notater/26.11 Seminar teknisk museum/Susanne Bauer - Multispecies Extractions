Susanne Bauer - Multispecies Extractions for re-engineering salmon and human metabolism

How to go beyond the processes of comodification? What is the good that is being created? The project suddenly came to be about Artificail (marine) intelligence, after decades of research in the wetlab. Susanne uses metabolic relations that is both used by Mol and Marx, as a link between research communities across the wetlab and the lab-bench: and industrial materiality part of neutritan science. 

Can draw on decades of research in the food industry, since the 50s and 60s, and put it into the database. Working on a prediction machine that will produce goods in the future, as markeds, demands, production conditions, regulations, climate change, etc. change. Produces flexibility. 

The multispecies assemblage consists of libraries of different species, including humans. In this context human tests actually works as a model for animal tests. 

Like the other researchers she is following the contexts, into the kindergardens for example. 

Bowker comments about the immpossiblity of modeling scales from the atom, gene, protein, network, cell, tissue, organ, organ system, organism, enrionment. Susanne sais its a form of futuring. 

*The vocabularies are working on and drawing together different scales.
