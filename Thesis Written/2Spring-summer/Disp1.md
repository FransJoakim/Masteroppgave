How is learning done as an open epistemic object in networked education technologies?

#Introduction

###An ethnographic study of office spaces and its relationality in schools
This thesis is about in-between spaces and sorting things out. (among other: the virtual space)
Having a plan - the mess in the office and the politics in the mess - knowledge management systems
Organizing organizational practices and technologies - boundary infrastructure

Even though many of my thoughts about the field I studied was formed through my own experiences at the school I participated at I was surprised about how quickly these thoughts were resonated in the voices of others and summed up an issue so quickly.

I had conversations with groups and individuals.. like a mapping-study... In no trivial way did the situation liken to a focus group interview - except for the mediation of Maddie as the teacher and my own 'participatory' role in an ongoing enterprise. The similarity of these situations had in fact been one of my key inspirations for conducting this kind of research... These had been in-between spaces of study of objects.. in which the object emerged through the mediation of an observer..

but it was the mediation of such worldly reflections, their uptake and the study of their use that had fascinated me.. I participate - observed and participated in practices of .... I do the work of analytically putting these pieces back together in a meaningful way.
Stepping up in front of the groups.. what's my role? - managing people - care
What is so fascinating about using the STS perspective? - The heritage from, and development since, Latour.
Changing USE - From social work in science to transnational understandings.

What is seen is that the starting point in the question of mobility assumes the impact of the ubiquity of these technologies. The digital is a very broad category of objects and one which is hard to define, and not least to study. Nevertheless, it is relational between practices and it is productive - it produces something by itself, which is essential to understand to be able to study these objects and networks.

In Selwyn [-@selwyn_education_2014, pp. 164] states that sociologists of education should be paying closer attention to the digital. In his analysis of exemplary works of analysis of new media and the political economy of education technology, he highlights how digital technologies are now embedded so deeply into the everyday of education that they should not remain only of interest to researchers who have a specific personal interest in the ‘high tech’. Selwyn asks why relatively few deliberate accounts of digital technology been produced within the sociology of education, despite regular calls for a ‘high-tech soc-of-ed’, and despite the fact that (as he aim at showing) digital technologies play into existing issues of inequality and exclusion, power differentials, correspondences between education and (global) economics, and the commercialization of public services (p.155-156).

##STS - the 'Sociology of Science and Technology' or 'Science and Technology in Society'
STS is sometimes called both of the above titles. Since STS is a multidisciplinary field, it is important to clarify what scholarly traditions that this thesis aim towards contributing to, so to be able to argue for the value of this contribution.

Estrid Sørensen () sets out with the explicit purpose of going beyond studying technology in education as a means to an end. Sørensen aims at developing theoretical technologies that may help the study of 'the materiality of learning', an effort that is meant to expand the boundaries of education research and which she therefore calls a _methodological_ approach (p.13).

She concentrates on the 'practice of learning' (p.178) and considers learning as 'analytically secondary' (p.), meaning that she considers concepts of learning as an result of analysis rather than necessarily predefined and measured. She has the ambition of being ontological, meaning that she is concerned with how humans and things _become_ as effects of the arrangements in which they are entangled. This philosophically pragmatic approach allows us to imagine how practice could be different - how human and things could be rearranged and reconfigured along new forms of technology, knowledge, presence and learning (p.13).

I study infrastructure, its production and the valuation work happening in these processes.
Both theoretical technologies and digital techniques - what I define through the idea of 'search'.

This is an answer to calls in sociology of educational literature:

"Notwithstanding this absence, a sizable academic literature has formed around the technical, pedagogical and psychological aspects of technology and education. Yet these ‘Ed Tech’ accounts remain disappointingly a-political and a-social, finding little common ground with critical educational studies and/or sociology of education. Indeed, the majority of writing on education and digital technology has functioned either to promote the learning potential and pedagogic possibilities of technology, or else support practitioner use of specific tools and applications."(156) It is a mistake to presume ‘the digital’ to constitute completely new and improved educational terrain. "Amidst the supposed ‘transformatory’ and ‘disruptive’ connotations of these developments, the ‘digital age’ marks a continuation of a number of longstanding educational tensions"(@selwyn_education_2014 p.155).

Li... (p.518) argues that it is important to recognize the pre-existence of ‘structural conditions’ which learners confront in any e-learning setting and therefore calls for a careful re-think of the relationship between learner, context and technology.
"It is as if, in order to avoid ‘technology determinism’ and focus on human agency, an alternative framing of learning context as enacted through recurrent use of technology must be taken. By revisiting the debate on the metaphor of ‘affordance’ of technology, it asserts the importance of understanding the physical properties of technology as potential structural powers in human interaction with technology, without conflating them with our interpretation of and practice with technologies"517

This calls for a study of the user within a larger complex, and a new sociology of education. 'The user matters' >
-The role of technology in society (the history of the pickup): lets practical use emerge as a result of negotiations between the users and the networks that make the technology a reality. Practices of design, production and marketing are however negotiated within a large complex of industry and social change.
-The many ontologies of farmers (the role of science in society): Bureaucracy work, projects and separation between the two.. PROJECT experimentation

###Open Educational Resources
Building on the 'Directed Community' Model

###mobile education
Li: 'As we witness the expansion of learning beyond physical and institutional boundaries with the use of digital technologies, the question of the context of learning re-emerges as a point of concern. Moreover, he states that the ‘mutually constitutive’nature and inseparability of individual and society pose difficulties for us in defining both individual learners and learning contexts, and in analysing human interaction with technology and wider aspects of the learning context.
In rejecting the idea of a context as a bounded container within which learning takes place, much research in educational technology adopts a more fluid and contingent view of context as being co-emergent with recurrent social practice with technology. Such framing can be very appealing, given the difficulties of defining the boundary of the learning context in situations such as online courses like MOOCs and mobile learning.
Li: Only through accepting an analytical dualism of learner and context can we adequately understand and analyse their interaction in the constitution and working out of this learning phenomenon. To better appreciate the capacity within course design one then have to understand what takes place during a the learner–course interaction, rather than assuming that learning is simply and linearly determined by the technology and structures we embed in a course. 518

Therein also lies a difference between the methodological approach and a more formal sociological one.
Like Sørensen I choose to study these dualisms between technologies and humans in one school. We could say that I study them in the boundary work and boundary infrastructure in one place. This is not unusual in feminist and STS tradition. I want to study learning in compulsory education as an institutionalized phenomenon in a time of technological disruption. More than that though this dynamic is more fundamentally theorized in the problematization of learning as a phenomenon, and a phenomenology that relate to common governance processes - and as part of the mobile
This is what I hope to do with the idea of search - A Foucauldian idea of governance of mobile education.

We move from Bourdieu and the idea of genre to the idea of geneology. We see this same dynamic in Sørensen's writing:
Estrid Sørensen have taken the multi-sitedness and/or multidimensional(socio-techinical) of such materialities seriously in her analysis of the socio-material forms an spaces of the classroom. Her research unfolded from the end of the 90s to the end of the 2000s and according to her own account her interest begun in questions of educational practices in cyberspace and the possible semiotic significance of hypertext therein. Constructing a program called Femdedit.. Although she hoped to do theoretical work within the bounds of the developmental practice of her own team of programmers and the two schools they had allied themselves with the research led her on to considering the theoretisation of educational technologyh more general.
Simply put, this was because the 'epistemological object' that was the product of their research and development (R&D) efforts and their 'experimental system' was subject to 'trials of strength' within the bounds of the school and educational practice.


##The school as an ecology
To understand the PROJECT work of the new experimental system we use the ecological model.

Much of the thesis is structured around a critique of Sørensen's work, and its new materialism. My experience is that in the STS tradition such critiques are not as an established a form of scholarly contribution as in other disciplines. Now, perhaps because of this, STS is often not considered a field at all. In much of the STS literature the 'pragmatic move' towards the epistemological is often one in which authors add to the corpus of STS terminology by deploying them in their own accounts, rather than debating how these terms are commonly used and/or defined. The reiteration of critical approaches to the materialist tradition in STS that this study is part of is therefore one that deals with some of the methodological challenges of the field. Furthermore, it is also a continuation of Sørensen theoretical work and what is now understood as the socio-cultural (¤) approach. The theory producing (rather than testing) tradition within STS that Sørensen takes part in is a product of its feminist inclinations. Sørensen's 'methodological' approach/account simultaneously tells the story of her ethnographic fieldwork and how her research question and/or object (which normally, in a formalistic sense, is laid out as the premise at the beginning of a study) both developed together throughout her book as her work produces theory. My critical approach is therefore an application of her theory, in which I share her critical inclinations towards her initial assumptions and try to understand how the theory could be applied if our presumptions about the digital, and about new educational technologies, are seen in light of new developments in digital STS, digital ethnography, the ethnography of boundary infrastructure, and document and value studies.

This is what I understand as a study of the history of the open in education and elsewhere. The critical element is the relational approach to production that is seen as necessary to study to understand boundary objects, boundary infrastructure and boundary work. Or, as what in the Foucauldian tradition is called the move from bio-politics back to bio-economics.

I study the 'experimental system' in schools, a concept closely related to 'the boundary object'.
I follow the open into the compulsary education system.
Establishing contact and becoming part of a team. The outsider-insider question.
My relationship with the school system and my journey - Questions and assumptions about my split intentions.
The researcher and the tutors - evaluation (as commonality and theoretical function)
Measuring practices
I ask: -How is scientific knowledge and market mechanisms co-created in new ways of measuring learning in new media?

The political economy of education - The 'knowledge economy' and the over-supply of information
Accounting practice of the longtail and the production of content - EdTech: the meeting between Ed and Tech


##The structure of my study
More specifically I ask how the materiality of learning is changed by the Learning Management Systems (LMS) that rapidly have spread throughout the Norwegian education system, and the education systems of the world.

This is an *ANT* approach to an LMS, that places these technologies and their so called Learning Service Providors (LPS) in a network of itself.

I study the internal structuring of these network practices at the school that I am at through my analysis of the spaces of the school and the practices that organizes these spaces.

My point of departure in my study of teachers was therefore the material practices that positions teachers at the crux of circulating learning resources, giving them the status of objective observer.

I nevertheless depart with many essentialist ideas of technology, seeing the teacher as multiple. And I develop an analytical frame of a cultural market, in which I theorize how externalities co-emerges within the education system and in the proprietary markets of the school and their geographies.  

These externalities should be understood as genres in the bourdieun sense, and could be seen as much as part of the 'The broken system' narrative or the technical literature as My context:
-How does boundary infrastructures mediate the implementation of 'goals for learning' as a metrological practice in the Norwegian school reform "kunnskapsløftet"?*the equality idea*

I follow these externalities from practices of evaluation to practices in which sharing is produced as an ideal. I look at these ideals in a few documents and programs in the new LMS, office 365. From there I try to track the relationship between these documents/programs and processes elsewhere that define geopolitics of these technologies of calculability.

In compulsary education as elsewhere one off course encounter issues of access to spaces of production and calculation. Nevertheless, I do aim at getting a overview of how technologies are given value between instances of the a municipally, a flat working landscape of what we think of as 'autonomous learners', and a national, international and transnational measuring system.
I do it in an ecological sense, with its own epistemological challenges. In trying to re-conceptualize relations of power we move back towards the Latourian account, but it is done to show that the power-relation always was part of the ecological account.

I therefore rely more heavily on a multi-sited ethnography, or in the Latourian sense 'follow scientists and engineers out into society' and try to understand how they work to re-implement these technologies into the school system. How the integration of digital infrastructures into the classroom adapts the experimental system of the classroom into cybernetic ideas of memory.

#Educational space - experimental space

###The science room
*the projector in this room is a technology that isn't networked*
My first day: the meeting with the science room. A hidden away, but nicely furnished, room. Pipes that ensures air being carried away above the work stations that align the students in two rows in front of the classroom, up beyond their desks.. I'm there to look at the projector and talk about the issue of its implementation in the science teachers' systems. I quickly find myself outside the contained space of the classrooms I have yet to negotiate my presence in. I'm in a back room and in the presence a group who does not know that I am a researcher. It's a subject that I'm not too familiar with, but I know that it is invested heavily in.

In here the experiment is in no way only a metaphorical construct of my own. This is the space of STS and of the intermixing of ideals of education and science. What is the relationship of this space to the rest of the empty spaces? The people that are confronting me with the purpose of my research are kids. I had thought of it as a fun experiment presenting my research as social scientific and had spent some time fantasising about how to construct a narrative that put the social scientific relevance of the internet into perspective for them. However, the social science disappeared, or was never constructed. My relatively open ended ethnographical approach lead me to shorten my account of my own intentions to the minimal, but standing in the science room as we were the topic of my research also came to sound less 'social', so to say. My surprise could have been the result of my own lack of experience with the field of STS and its so called 'open ontology'(?), however what was striking was also how quickly the kids adopted the idea of the relevance of 'technology in schools, such as computers and stuff,' for themselves. The kids were all more than willing to talk about their own experience, both positive and negative. Perhaps out of an opportunistic willingness to avoid the topic of the 'actual class', or because of their fondness of talking about themselves and their own experiences to me as an outsider with interest in them and in the presence of each other. But although these possibilities are probably both equally likely to be true, the relevance of the topic to their lives and to the subject we were all attending - the subject-space - it is also likely to simply have been fascinating to them. We were really discussing the 'science of these new objects'. Their qualities as fascinating objects.

Estrid Sørensen have taken the multi-sitedness and/or multidimensional(socio-techinical) of such materialities seriously in her analysis of the socio-material forms an spaces of the classroom. Her research unfolded from the end of the 90s to the end of the 2000s and according to her own account her interest begun in questions of educational practices in cyberspace and the possible semiotic significance of hypertext therein. Constructing a program called Femdedit.. Although she hoped to do theoretical work within the bounds of the developmental practice of her own team of programmers and the two schools they had allied themselves with the research led her on to considering the theoretisation of educational technologyh more general.
Simply put, this was because the 'epistemological object' that was the product of their research and development (R&D) efforts and their 'experimental system' was subject to 'trials of strength' within the bounds of the school and educational practice.

In a similar manner as Sørensen I'm confronted with the methodological challenge of simultaneously studying the position of the new 3D-smartboard and confronting the task of observing its position in relations to several different objects and topics in my interaction with the group. The topic of our conversation revolved around how the practice of using computers was evolving with the use of the cloud. I had introduced the topic of computers and said that I was fascinated with the way they all now brought these computers with them and how it could change the way schools were run. I introduced questions of mobility, which are difficult questions. The group however basically answered with a summary of the arguments for the value of cloud computing in education before they turned to its critique. Largely they took the largest benefits for granted, or as a starting point for our discussion.

The relationship between their computers and the projector certainly become evident later on as Maddie turned on the projector and showed us what was done on her computer, attached through a cord. In the discussion how the infrastructure structured their work. How it was fair and unfair, and how they as a group were adapting or struggling to adapt (Star - being included in the understanding). One comment surprised me; that they could read what they had read. It was logical enough, but the purpose of writing was surely shaping their hand writing if they couldn't read their own texts. These were clearly practices and technologies of the self in almost a simplistic very functional (not necessary power - not yet), but it was also a topic concerning the ontology of the learner: data that generates itself.

Furthermore, even though the smartboard is positioned in front of the class the room as a whole is characterized by the variety of interesting items, all characterized as being on display within class cabinets and many of which are both virtual simulations of real objects, though in different sizes, and interactive along several dimensions - seeing one could take these models apart and study their modular forms from the inside and from the perspective of the components that made up the layers and established them as, for example, organs. What was more, the glass cabinet that displayed these objects at the side of the room were permanent fixtures. Elementary to the architecture of the room. The same kind of display design had fascinated and frustrated me from the time that I entered secondary school myself to the time that I left, more than ten years ago. In a similar vein to the new and perhaps even more fancy technology that hid inside the software of the new smartboard, its tentalising properties remained distant to us and was less a feature of our education per se as much as a feature of the room. It was as if there was a socio-cultural market for these kinds of objects within this categorical subject-space.

flow of people

###The classroom - a referential space
'Working out the mathematical truths of nature'? the tree - the referential idea of measures.
Getting tasks and completing them.. or completing something sometimes - some_'things' some_'times'.

Getting tasks and testing new truths up against old systems (technology)
The lively experience, the lively truth - discussions and the flow of 'old technologies'
Are old technologies done in a new way?

The renewal of the 'subject-space' *the DNA-person vs. the what-do-you-want-to-know-person*

Norwegian: Articles and objectivity
English: What do you know about Britian (category) and what do you want to know?

###The classroom - a space of self-regulation and flow
Sørensen made analytical distinctions based on ideas of 'virtual-essence'. By *participating* a more classical ethnographical approach I studies how the virtual is part of, and is done.

The interestment of students in the virtual space of the many technologies - the classroom.
Technique (as knowledge and creativity), instructions = search

The example of the Christmas activities - The teachers coming in and out
The construction of creativity as measurement practices - equality and democracy.
directing creative search and regulating space
Fitting into slots.

The music class in the hallway - porøse boundaries and the classroom
The instrument as a fluent search object - fluent in presence, geography and participation/social constellations.
These fluent spaces worked well for activities like handing back grades.
*boundary activities*

###Extra-ordinary activities
Boarders between rooms are lowered.
Sometimes using technology by itself to regulate space.
The teacher then enacts the face-to-face conversation (alone) - its not in the individual/virtual person within the technology.
Using highly 'creative' technologies could be difficult to maintain separations between things and kids.
*kids gain independence in relation to educational technology (Simon's theory would mean that kids being handled through technologies also could be doing more 'abstract' work)*

The Christmas Dance - a traditional activity
Using tables and kahoot to reconstitute groupings and social setting - the civil performance of adulthood
Giving some students more freedom - as I noticed this 'space' ate into my classes

Special role of the 10th grader graduates is enacted through documents.
The documents divides responsibility between teachers while - the machinery of the semester takes some time to come to an end.
The external documents (ROS) are not just there as an alliance between the teacher and the majority. These documents are interventions into the teachers role, letting the organization re-generate itself.
Boundary work between the professional space of teachers and parents.

###The hallway
The ecological space (of the hallway)- the local: the retention of kids OR/AND the division of work?
Care, equality and the cultural market - using metaphors 'methodologically'(¤)
Perspectives of the other (democracy enacted), self-transformation (parents) evaluation (credits) laws and rights.

The conversation in the hallway - maintaining the space

##Conclusion


###The seminar-room (down the valley)
The school: The new school is more like an ecological container of sociological spaces.
The spaces in-between is characteristic.
Teachers' restricted autonomy & 'handlingsrom'

###'Handlingsrom' and spaces
Why are some rooms almost empty and others full?
Organizing organizers: learning is organized
The Christmas Dance, the freedom of the students and the emerging significance of documents.
