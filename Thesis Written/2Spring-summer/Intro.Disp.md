##2 Teorikapittel 7
###2.1 Introduksjon... 7
This thesis is about in-between spaces and sorting things out. (among other: the virtual space)
Having a plan - the mess in the office and the politics in the mess - knowledge management systems
Organizing organizational practices and technologies - boundary infrastructure

###2.2 Vitenskaps- og teknologistudier ... 7
What is so fascinating about using the STS perspective? - The heritage from, and development since, Latour.
Changing USE - From SCOT/'science in society' towards society in science (transnational understandings).
I participate - observed and participated in practices of ..*Latourian lay-man's approach to technical work(as opposed to the same text-cut in methods section below)*...

I am both managing people and investigating practices of care (as a science practice - in cultural market) and the political economy of evaluation - interestment.
As a participant I am also on a journey through the university and research communities - a journey through education system and the dynamics of a changing landscape in the knowledge system
These are also journeys through theory and the feminist-material tradition - building on ideas of transnational structures and practices of translation
transnational infrastructure - the political economy of scientific infrastructure and the making of nature

I do the work of analytically putting these pieces back together in a meaningful way.
Understanding the ANT through French-Marxism: Foucault - from bio-politics to bio-economics - and the cultural turn as a reading of Bourdieu

Suchman: the politics of design - and thinking machines
The politics of work-thinking: machines as scripted devices.
Towards Callon - translation and interestment
neolib./new public management and measurement practices - metrics and autonomy
From centers of calculation to Calculation devices - markets


###2.3 Inspirasjon fra teknografi og *the issue of studying the digital*... 9
The antroplogy of socio-techinical cultures - my inspiration from the Bjørnhaug's thesis: the travel and translation of a technology
In public controversy, technical (*market*) actors and the health care institution

However, my interests started with the LMS and the politics and controversy around its potential (first in my experience and then through my essay).
The object was truly controversial and understudied - loosely defined at all ends. I first thought to go back to itslearning (lSPs) and investigate further the glitch between their vision of a PLE and the administrative system that was reported upon. However, I was drawn to a broader and more participatory approach. I became drawn to this through the conclusion of my essay, in which I understood LMSs to become marginalized despite their continuous growth, as major external actors (outside the LPS sector) were intervening into the socio-technical field. This was a technology that had never been 'closed', and that
**Instead of wanting to study the LMS, I started to understand that the market mechanisms that make it difficult to look beyond the current limitations of the technology also were the interesting object to study. The network had potential for growth even as it was, but this was not realized since the architecture that most associated with the LMS was a product of a lack of design specified elsewhere in the market. Those who had the means to influence and co-ordinate such organizational wide strategies weren't even the politicians, it was people with competences that just weren't valued enough in the organizational structure of the school. Rather they were all waiting for new products. These could perhaps use the same technological platform, or a different one, but the school would simply switch provider. It was ultimately a service, and the question became what was the factors that shaped these responsibilities among service and product providers. I wanted to study these on up close, while also getting to grips with the multitude of options. This was the market, and I didn't want to fix in on the potential of one of these products for learning or anything else when they weren't products in the first place. These were just as much types of bureaucracies**

I found out that it was not one technology, and to study the direction of this controvercy (around meaning and use) within the organization and through practice
Actors were struggling for a position/responsibility within the emerging area of use: The agency to define, though the industrial complex of design - Service science.
The cloud - technical literature and definition problems, the geography of grids and social scientific methodological issues of access in a digital environment - the self-producing ontology

-The material foundation of knowledge is not new to social science however
Beyond the super-structure of state-knowledge in the historical-bloc among the French sociologists
I continue to balance this dynamic relationship between structuralism and post-structuralism: in the reading of digital labor
Marxism to political economy - historiography and the antropology of state/market boundaries

I ask are these augmentation technologies new? OR what is new about their high-tech/networked properties?
The adaption of digital competence in information systems - Beyond Suchman: Strategy in STS..



The STS of health care - Bauer: Surveillance and the harmonization of data.

Inspiration from the sociology of knowledge - from individuals to objects
I understand this as a foucauldian reading of the pol.sci. of the globalization question: (post-)neoliberalism (the superopticon) and post-society in theoretical analysis of network-centered calculation

State/market boundaries and document studies (Hull)
The study of innovation and the weakness of numbers (Asdal)

###2.4 STS in education and schools ... 10
Litaracy studies and genres of communication technologies - merging communication studies and STS
The history of STS in education and its relationship with mass media technologies
Sørensen and essentialism


Understanding measurement practices: accounting sciences and the pragmatic vs. the absolute
Pedagogies and ANT - the scientific intervention of cybernetic theories
Autonomy and dispersed/local harmonization - the geography of educational spaces

The materialities of learning and geopolitics of calculation - calculative power among communities and the gaming of measurement practices.

###3.1 Introduksjon... 17
Even though many of my thoughts about the field I studied was formed through my own experiences at the school I participated at I was surprised about how quickly these thoughts were resonated in the voices of others and summed up an issue so quickly.


###3.2 Konstruksjon av en forskningsstrategi... 17
###3.3 Etnografisk tilnærminger innen STS... 18
Ubiquity of digital technology & multi-sited methodologies
Studying boundary objects
Studying the 'politics of the open' in rec..(two-bits) communities

I had conversations with groups and individuals.. like a mapping-study... In no trivial way did the situation liken to a focus group interview - except for the mediation of Maddie as the teacher and my own 'participatory' role in an ongoing enterprise. The similarity of these situations had in fact been one of my key inspirations for conducting this kind of research... These had been in-between spaces of study of objects.. in which the object emerged through the mediation of an observer..

but it was the mediation of such worldly reflections, their uptake and the study of their use that had fascinated me.. I participate - observed and participated in practices of .... I do the work of analytically putting these pieces back together in a meaningful way.
