#(Working title) Fuck the Cloud: a critical approach to the geopolitics of calculation in Norwegian compulsory education.


#Introduction
"Fuck the cloud" was an expression used by a fellow student of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as he describes the text printed on his T-shirt. It reads "There is no place like 127.0.0.1". Each time anyone get to grips with the strangeness of unintelligible text Lasse, as he is called, makes a small effort to interest them in the topic and generously tries to include them in his community of cyber-activists. Most people can at that point guess at the fact that the code is written in some kind of computer language. Yet, the elegance and beauty of its meaning usually comes as a surprise. It often takes a moment to realize the obvious, that 127.0.0.1 is some kind of metaphor for 'home'. But the inscription could also be translated into something like a command written in any browser window, such as a 'web browser', to orient the author back to the directories and hard-drives of the device one is using - back to one's own computer, the catalogs of data that one ultimately could be said to 'own', and/or that is saved within ones property or a device at ones disposal. Despite most of us being unaware of it, almost all of us share a strong enough association with the technical devices that run the code to understand that its code overflow from the internal language of the computer and enmesh our individual selves with an imagined global society. Within the narrative of the text we both travel out into the virtual spaces of the global virtual landscape and come back a place that we associate with, and that we feel attached to. The computations that is read by computers is not simply binary. The binary relationships between computers and computer directories are simply 'virtual' in the sense that they operate virtually (geometrically, temporally and/or metaphorically) both among the components of electronic conductors - that make up 'the digital' - and their endless attachments - screens, people, stock markets, satellites, lawn mowers etc. Because of this we engage with what in social science has been called the 'movement of flows..?'...
Yet, within this confusion of spaces and metaphors we know there to be a difference between the fast expanding networks of 21st century information infrastructures and the machines we perceive to be carrying around and/or seem responsible for in some way or another. Our digital 'Home' has therefore become a crucial aspect of civic action. We know that our culture lack the language and theories to apply the networks that structure our conversation to adequately describe the problematic relationship mediated by the networks of wires, keyboards, screens etc. that play such an important part of our ways of knowing. This is not at all a new problem, but one that goes to the very core of the human condition, to modernity and to 'knowledge' as such. In STS the effects of this platonic 'gap' has been generalized to the level of the 'inherent partiality of knowledge' (Latour..). However, in the digital age network metaphors have come to hide this...
Awareness of this issue in the social sciences has resulted in a recent 'move' towards what @bowker2009toward in their title describes as 'information infrastructure studies' and 'ways of knowing in a networked environment'. This study concerns itself with ways of knowing ones own computer and local network. 

The white letters on the black background is paradigmatic of one of the greatest controversies unknown to most modern historians and social scientists. It is typical of computer systems that have not made the full conversion to the graphical user interface, and that became commonplace in the transition from Dos to Windows.


#Methodology

#Co-ordinating presence
Enacting an evolution/ecology: accountability (frontstage and backstage)
What is the meaning of a large information infrastructure in a school?
-more than just a classroom
How does the 'materialities of learning' shape the 'materialities of education'?
Infrastructurement in the PLE: learners shaping education - a discussion with a 'class'
Categorizing online phenomena and the problem of the non-user: non-educational activities
non-users in(vs.) automatic technological environments: 'sets'(networks among networks) and sporadic encounters
-the 'ins' and 'outs' of pedagogy: boundaries and 'local' geography

#Standardized Flexibility
Symmetry between online- and offline-governance: discipline between 'autonomous' actors
Observing the interventions of non-users - administrators and valuation practices
The idea of 'access' (in Dron & Anderson, 2014 & in the cloud) - Documents and databases
Multiple governance designs - the compulsion to control and measure - reform as 'game space'
Search..
The local adoption of regulations - the geography of the work-trip
What is regulated/measured: Projects and enterprises

#Techno-Economic Networks
Seeing ('digital') bureaucracy in action
Digital labor and 'ownership': emerging technology as the externalization of tools and internalization of learning
Understanding network boundaries through information science and through history
'Service science' and the economization of service-products: experimentation and stabilization
Professionalization, ethno-methodologies and calculative devices: caring for the meta

#Translating openness
Re-assembling the materialities of education
Agencified networks, under-determined institutions and caring for publics
The politics of 'individualizable' networks: the translation of openness
