#Imagining mobility

How do we imagine the mobile technologies being institutionalized and taking on a natural presence in the local economy? Education is certainly one arena in which such imaginative work is happening. Work that one in fields such as the anthropology and sociology of science and technology have come to describe as 'worlding'. The education system, and schools in particular, are now the subjects of popular and widespread criticism, as it is portrayed as having stood at a virtual stand still the last century. A great deal of the attention it has received could be attributed to the 'viral' spread of these ideas through new media channels online, but over the period I have done my research for this thesis I have also heard the argument repeatedly at talks. This new wave of criticism often comes from so called technologists in the field of EdTech (education technology), and reduced down to the typical statement that introduces these talks the classroom is seen as organized in an almost identical fashion to the way it is shown on pictures of classrooms a century and a half ago. While the rest of society has been radically re-shaped by the consecutive 'industrial revolutions' of the early, middle, and late twentieth century, the materiality of the classroom has survived into its third century. A variety of the argument draws this historical line of reasoning all the way back to the first universities, in the beginning of the last millennium, when pictures show groups of bored and tired Arab scholars lined up in rows in front of a lecturer reading out of a book.

No matter, the argument holds to the extent that it highlights change that is now said to be underway. In the 'viral' sensation that was spawned by Ken Robinson's talk in... we learn that all countries on on the planet are now reforming their public education system. And as it represent a humongous market..

-mobility was a question in the classic SCOT study of cars. What needed to be moved shaped the car into the pickup.

-SÃ¸rensen leaves one question open: how is authority established within materialities of flow, and this is the question that I hope to answer.

In the first chapter the question of how mobility is imagined is examined through the portable computer. The computer circulates within a network of educational spaces; the classroom, preparatory work (individual teachers), preparatory planning meetings, and administrative accounting practices.

Whether to study practice or socio-materiality is a difficult question. For example, Lee has studied energy by studying a variety of empirical objects and practices used in the construction of energy as a truth. On the other hand, practice could also be seen simply within the classroom. In the latter, a question is left open. What impact does a new device have upon practice.

What does establishing authority within the materiality of flow got to do with the building of LMS networks?
Installation is a form of infrastructuring. The installation of the cloud system raised a lot of questions in which some boundary objects appeared. Accounting practices are used to create and develop these empirical objects.

In the second chapter we see that the worlds that are created independently within games form a independent dynamic. Like the red cross booklet, games made by organizations like the red cross have at best been inconsistent with the processes of project development. These are rationalizing games and exist in great variety. Those dealing with the logic and science behind colors are perhaps easier to integrate, but again one is assuming that color understanding is a fundamental part of the learning of the creative process in schools. The games that are being integrated manage to transcend the 'logical' boundaries, by not rationalizing or establishing a world of its own.

-Third party services does some of the activity.
