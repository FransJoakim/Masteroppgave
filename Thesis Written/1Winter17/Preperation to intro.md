#Contextualisation

I want to study learning in compulsory education as an institutionalized phenomenon in a time of technological disruption.

My object of study is the infrastructure and the material practices that positions teachers at the crux of circulating learning resources, giving them the status of objective observer.

I ask:

-How is scientific knowledge and market mechanisms co-created in new ways of measuring learning in new media?

More specifically I ask:

-How does boundary infrastructures mediate the implementation of 'goals for learning' as a metrological practice in the norwegian school reform "kunnskapsløftet"?


In Selwyn [-@selwyn_education_2014, pp. 164] states that sociologists of education should be paying closer attention to the digital. In his analysis of exemplary works of analysis of new media and the political economy of education technology, he highlights how digital technologies are now embedded so deeply into the everyday of education that they should not remain only of interest to researchers who have a specific personal interest in the ‘high tech’. Selwyn asks why relatively few deliberate accounts of digital technology been produced within the sociology of education, despite regular calls for a ‘high-tech soc-of-ed’, and despite the fact that (as he aim at showing) digital technologies play into existing issues of inequality and exclusion, power differentials, correspondences between education and (global) economics, and the commercialization of public services (p.155-156).

"Notwithstanding this absence, a sizable academic literature has formed around the technical, pedagogical and psychological aspects of technology and education. Yet these ‘Ed Tech’ accounts remain disappointingly a-political and a-social, finding little common ground with critical educational studies and/or sociology of education. Indeed, the majority of writing on education and digital technology has functioned either to promote the learning potential and pedagogic possibilities of technology, or else support practitioner use of specific tools and applications."(156) It is a mistake to presume ‘the digital’ to constitute completely new and improved educational terrain. "Amidst the supposed ‘transformatory’ and ‘disruptive’ connotations of these developments, the ‘digital age’ marks a continuation of a number of longstanding educational tensions"(p.155).

Li... (p.518) argues that it is important to recognize the pre-existence of ‘structural conditions’ which learners confront in any e-learning setting and therefore calls for a careful re-think of the relationship between learner, context and technology.
"It is as if, in order to avoid ‘technology determinism’ and focus on human agency, an alternative framing of learning context as enacted through recurrent use of technology must be taken. By revisiting the debate on the metaphor of ‘affordance’ of technology, it asserts the importance of understanding the physical properties of technology as potential structural powers in human interaction with technology, without conflating them with our interpretation of and practice with technologies"517

'As we witness the expansion of learning beyond physical and institutional boundaries with the use of digital technologies, the question of the context of learning re-emerges as a point of concern. Moreover, he states that the ‘mutually constitutive’nature and inseparability of individual and society pose difficulties for us in defining both individual learners and learning contexts, and in analysing human interaction with technology and wider aspects of the learning context.

In rejecting the idea of a context as a bounded container within which learning takes place, much research in educational technology adopts a more fluid and contingent view of context as being co-emergent with recurrent social practice with technology. Such framing can be very appealing, given the difficulties of defining the boundary of the learning context in situations such as online courses like MOOCs and mobile learning.

Only through the of accepting an analytical dualism of learner and context can we adequately understand and analyse their interaction in the constitution and working out of this learning phenomenon. To better appreciate the capacity within course design one then have to understand what takes place during a the learner–course interaction, rather than assuming that learning is simply and linearly determined by the technology and structures we embed in a course. 518


## The pragmatic turn in methodological research.

Estrid Sørensen () sets out with the explicit purpose of going beyond studying technology in education as a means to an end. Sørensen aims at developing theoretical technologies that may help the study of 'the materiality of learning', an effort that is meant to expand the boundaries of education research and which she therefore calls a _methodological_ approach (p.13). In a similar fashion to Li she means to sidestep arguments about the _situated_ character of learning - how 'ability and talent arise in a dynamic transaction among the individual, the physical environment, and the sociocultural context' (Barab and Plucker, 2002, as cited in Sørensen, 2009, p.11). As opposed to Li, who asks researchers to head the theoretical demands of analytical dualism, Sørensen's methodological approach is a 'minimal methodology' (p.12). It avoids any kind of analytical dualism between learner and institution/society. She states that 'When the focus is on learning efficiency, on motivation, on collaboration, and on other human or social phenomena, the only part technology is able to play in the research accounts is that of a means to a social, psychological, or pedagogic ends'(p.6). This is what is known among writers within the tradition of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a 'pragmatic turn', inspired by the pragmatic philosophy of John Dewey.

Dewey said that values and ethics are..

She concentrates on the 'practice of learning' (p.178) and considers learning as 'analytically secondary' (p.), meaning that she considers concepts of learning as an result of analysis rather than necessarily predefined and measured.

ANT goes beyond issue of value..

She has the ambition of being ontological, meaning that she is concerned with how humans and things _become_ as effects of the arrangements in which they are entangled. This philosophically pragmatic approach allows us to imagine how practice could be different - how human and things could be rearranged and reconfigured along new forms of technology, knowledge, presence and learning (p.13).

This has been an important point for Harraway.. We have many identities simultaneously.
The learner matters for more than his interaction with the technology..

The literature on high tech in education similarly talks about how education could be done better and how to adapt it to a language of educators, that is they strive for evidence based research. However, the social construction of facts is based on a materiality which is necessarily taken for given.

(added 27th feb.) Instead of studying learners in the context of learning at schools I rather aim at describing the materialities that are taken for granted.

The idea of learning ends up as an idea of literacy.. But as studies of metrological practice has shown it is often a practice of gamification that emerges..


## The user matters > the many ontologies of farmers (the role of science in society)

lets practical use emerge as a result of negotiations between the users and the networks that make the technology a reality. Practices of design, production and marketing are however negotiated within a large complex of industry and social change.

Users matter especially in the situation of technology which rely on user-development (open source) such as teachers developing their own teaching programs involving different technology..

This is especially true in the development and discrimination between the PC and the internet.. communities of academia and publics outside interested with the freedom of information.. Students are native digitals, which clearly matters.. They have even helped the teacher.. a shift away from the student as consumer and towards the role of creator is prophesised - which share very interesting cultural .. with the free software movement of the 90s, when the reforms of the previous generation was introduced.

Although we wish to overcome the notion of educational research of technology being limited to the 'best-practice' agenda it would be a mistake to ignore the literature, which often works its way around the material complex/infrastructure/language of the educational establishment. A language has emerged of the ecology of resources, which to a varying degree could be structured around the needs of the learner, the teacher or other sections of the institution. *the complex of industry and social change*

These materialistic accounts should be familiar to students of STS. The ecological perspective was most famously developed by Susan Leigh Star [-@star_institutional_1989) who in her account of the museum of.. in which she challenged the ideas of one of the founding figures of the field, namely Bruno Latour. Star challenges the idea that scientists agree.. and arguably it is a challenge to the idea of 'centers of calculation'(?). The issue with the idea of the entrepreneurial scientist the clear narrative with which the story is approached. Star tries to amend this tendency by taking the perspective of the organization. Star is famous for taking infrastructure serious (relative to Haraway).. Star points out the role infrastructure tends to play as boundary objects, allowing for many different uses, even when often defined as the same, such as walking (relevant for my study). The bridge is different for the walker, driver, engineer, politician etc. More importantly however, infrastructure is transparent to use when it does not have to be reinvented or assembled for each task, and therefore embodies standards by plugging into other infrastructures - modified by scope and conflicting conventions.

Teachers have their own recursive interests, though building on their own materials.. Sociology necessary..
Sørensen tries to build theoretic technologies to create a language to talk about learning.. This way it is a critical perspective towards established ways of 'seeing' technology. Computers are often seen as tools used in upgrading a workforce (notater) (the teachers work is affected by recursive ideals of 'the open' - resources - added 27th feb). This needs to happen whilst also making education meaningful.. but these aren't simply empty promises. The agenda of self-regulation is not a new one. It is one which permiate the education system and liberal thinking. The autonomous school 'economizes' many of the processes of learning. The system is to prepare children for their adult jobs. We however continue to invest in systems for referential learning.. Large information systems which allows students to come back to an issue later, as long as she/he know how to. Not everybody needs to know as much, as long as he/she is aware of his/her progress.

## The formative intention

Personalized learning is then a form of industrialization of learning. These standards must however be negotiated.. (gamification of learners and organizations).
When Kunnskapsløftet was enacted the Norwegian parliament in 2006 it represented a major educational reform. One of the central topics of the reform was the new National Curriculum that replaced the idea of ‘goals of knowledge’ with that of ‘goals of competence’ (Engh, 2009, p.2). Alongside these conceptual developments steps were being taken to improve upon the results of international tests that had begun at the turn of the century, and which had seriously challenged previous beliefs in the high quality of Norwegian school system. One of these steps was the introduction national tests that negotiated between strongly held positions among teachers, regulators and experts.

The ‘formative intention’ behind standards of national testing were key to the resolution of the stand-off between interest groups that had first halted their introduction due to ardent protests among teachers in 2005. Results were not published openly to avoid the formation of league tables. Rather they were formulated as tools for the teacher to assist him/her to teach according to the students’ learning needs (Engh, 2009, p.1). This would become known as the idea of "assessment *for* learning" (as opposed to assessment *of* learning). A term that emerged through the work of a two-year project lead by the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training (Utdanningsdirektoratet (UDIR)) called Improving Assessment Practice. At that point the controversy formed around the question whether national standards would contribute to a more equal and fair assessment practice and how expertise could be utilized to create space for change.

The ecology could be different, and change the role of the teacher. The high tech literature explores this space and re-orders the sciences..
Interactiveness and intersubjectivity..






### Edtech: the science of the education technology user

Digital technologies in the realm of education is laying the foundation of new fields of science, engineering and management under the banner of EdTech. The term EdTech is short for Education Technology, bus as Hege Tollerud (2016), head of Oslo EdTech Cluster, recently explained at a seminar at the University Collage of Oslo and Akershus, it is important to appreciate the fact that EdTech also represents more than an abbreviation of terms. Education Technology represents an area of development in which the world of Ed - educators - and Tech - technologists - meet, and in which their interests are negotiated.

Tollerud explains that Norwegian EdTech has an international pressense that puts it at the frontline of development, and that this is primarily due to Norwegian experties within education. The idea of Norwegian EdTech being a propelled by knowledge in education is however not unproblematic. Many scholars today considers SCOT to have been a prefigure to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), as the co-evolution of the spheres of technology and science has became better understood..

On the one hand, large investments are being made to foster growth in innovative sectors that would integrate Oslo (and perhaps some other regional centers) into the .. triangle. Also, Politically Norway identifies with a wider Scandinavian model, in which Finland has been a leading example of innovation in Educational policy. On the other,  trust in the Norwegian model of compulsory education has been significantly compromized among Norwegian politicians since standardized international tests (the PISA test) were introduced around the turn of the millenium, and ranked Norwegian pupils among the ... average (...). EdTech also has the typical characteristic of a New Economy sector (...) that most of the technological innovation is happening in concentrated area, forming around a few highly influential educational institutions in Boston, Massachusetts. The size of the EdTech workforce in east-coast state was first quantified September of this year (2016) and counts 25000 jobs in 430 companies (90% of which are reporting that they are adding new positions and hiring employees) making EdTech an increasingly vital part of the region's innovation economy. The reach of these networks forming within the EdTech ecosystem stretches around the planet. The decision of LEGO Education to move the Denmark-based toy giant’s educational business to Boston in 2015 represents only one of the related sectors merging with it. Technological giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon all maintain education teams and projects in the area and Edtech companies have started coming to Boston from digital hot spots like Ireland and Israel, the booming markets of Asia, as well as the rapidly evolving economies of the Persian Gulf. And international investors are following suit. @Learnlaunch
(We move away from fancy screens - aimed at preserving local autonomy by virtue of action oriented policy and innovative ambitions that over emphasize human science of pedagogy - to a mechanized and industrialized network using science to create markets though standards of policy and implementation - added 27th feb).







I want to argue that understanding the practices that have allowed such standards to underpin calculative work on a national scale is of fundamental importance to understanding socio-technical issues in compulsory education in Norway today.






I want to ask, like the researchers in UDIR’s project did, how the formation of national standards act upon local variations. However, am not making generalizations about the potential of these new practices of measurement and control. I want to study how the building of these large information systems rely upon general propositions about these technologies - how they make acts of measurement co unnoticed. How they work as ‘boundary infrastructures’ (Bowker & Star, 1999); as a means for translation and interesstement between groups who do not work around a consensus.  How imaginaries of agency are attached to the learner in these knowledge communities as they struggle with the burden of technology assisted and industrialized forms of self-assessment.

What agency is for example given to students in interactive media systems and how does these imaginaries direct efforts at individualizing Personal Learning Environments (PLEs)? (perhaps a essentialist question that is important to include - added feb)

*27th feb > On the other hand the neo-liberal agenda and its market driven economization models could be argued to be its own form of calculation and accounting - surveillance - categorization and cybernetic project*


Infrastructures by definition go unnoticed, which is how it is able to hold such enormous power over our lives - think for example about the vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation that allow us to fill our glasses in the nearest sink. Infrastructures are challenging to study, because as far as they are part of large technical systems and for this reason are understood differently within different discourses - i.e. among those who are *not* served by a particular infrastructure, like wheelchair users in front of a staircase, or engineers who who encounter infrastructures as topics different problem areas (Star, 1999, p.380).



My interest in the issue was however formed by my experience working as a teacher at a secondary school between degrees.

My experience was described well in Rita Helgesen, Sylvia Lind and Håkon Haugli’s recent article in Dagens Næringsliv called ‘simplistic digital school’ (Lettvint digital skole). The authors are leading representatives from national interest groups for students, teachers (lektorer) and knowledge-intensive industries respectively. They claim that most of the funds that is being spent at digitizing Norwegian compulsory education is being used up by the school owners. When the politicians decided that all students should be using PCs and tablets the school owners have responded by tying the funds for educational materials to a National Digital Learning Arena (Nasjonal Digital Learningsarena - NDLA). According to Helgesen, Lind and Haugli the NDLA does not offer any real alternative to textbooks, but rather an on-screen shortened down versions of the same material.

(*27th feb > 'externalizes' the making of materials by making boundaries among repositories (in SMARTboards, digital book repositories or NDLA (or even LMS) - all subject to market failures) trying to remain autonomous*)

Scarce budgetary funds is marginalizing the market for digital books and learning programs, which represents now only 10% of publishers’ offer of learning materials. Nevertheless, the NDLA is cheap because it is an internally constructed solution. On the other hand the government and the educational directory has been slow at introducing quality standards for digital learning materials. While in Denmark the government has investing heavily in establishing such standards, in Norway quality standards are being tested out in one subject to establish whether there is a need (Ibid). The government is simply not recognizing the necessity of upholding the teacher’s ability to choose among learning materials. Rather than pursuing the goal of establishing a functioning market, like in Denmark, the development of digital learning materials is handled at the local level, giving both the authors of the article and myself an impression of their ‘homemade’ quality.




- the practice of measurement and management of learning.

The study will be a participatory ethnographic one, in which I observe the work space, the organization of learning, and the building and maintenance of infrastructures and information systems. The site is not yet found. Being a participatory study the spaces and situations I will want to observe will negotiated at site.

My concerns are developed in response to literature in the sociology of science and technology and in accordance with its epistemological philosophy of  ‘new materialism’ I try to understand learning ‘analytically secondary’ (Sørensen, 2009). It is the infrastructures (physical and non-physical) that institutionalizes learning to the extent where in which it can be subjected to counting practices, and adhering measures of control, that I am concerned with.

These systems are measures of care.

Teachers operationalize them through intersubjective interpretation..

Changes happened because..

My thesis will be an ethnographic study of ‘Personal Learning Environments’ (PLEs) as ‘mobile learner generated contexts’ within the institutional setting of the school system in Norway.

The education goals of the

If we want to study learning as a material activity (learning as secondary) we have to study the ecologies of resources supporting different materialities of learning.

Sørensen teoretisert hvordan etablerte former for praksis er del av en materialitet som kontinuerlig er med på å etablere og forhandle frem forskjellige former for læring i skolen. Isteden for å prøve å kartlegge effekten på ‘læring’ som et forutinntatt forskningsobjekt har Sørensen sett på hvordan disse materialitetene sameksisterer, forhandles mellom, bygges på, og utvikles.

This epistemological philosophical approach that Sørensen takes to her ethnomethedology shows that i.e. books have to be understood in relation to their spatial properties in relation to the agents (in the classroom) that .. learning.

These are ecologies..

Learning cannot simply be understood as a goal, but we can say that learning happens in the ecology of interests. A similar understanding of the ecology of shared visions is the conception of boundary objects.

* How does the size of the material systems of the school sector organize its knowledge.

* How are digital learning technologies generating data that changes accounting measures within smart classrooms?

The literature

Ikke bare forklarer det hvordan læring teoretisk sett er situert som pedagogisk teori lenge har gjort, eller som pedagogikkens bruk av ANT, hvordan standardiserte tester eller andre enkelt teknologier er eksempler på det.

My work rests on the work on ecological methaphors developed in STS in recent years. Here no single technology stands out..
