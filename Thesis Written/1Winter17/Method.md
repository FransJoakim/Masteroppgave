@hammersley_ethnography:_1995

In STS style my thesis is doing theoretical work and undergoes a process of abstraction. It deals with a more selective representation of phenomena hoping to some degree provide some knowledge of why events occur in the patterned way they do . p.208

The formal semantics of inventories than list and sort 'folk' terms are of interest to me, but their meaning is interpreted as evidence of knowledge, belief and action that can be located within a more general analytic framework (, p. 211). Like much ethnography it takes a relatively large sample, looking at relationships across the whole corpus of data, as opposed to a discourse analysis of local patterns.

Concepts are to some degree 'observer-identified' (cited in Lofland, 1971; p.211) sometimes perhaps creating classifications that draw together under the aegis of a single type what for members of the community under study is a diverse and unrelated range of phenomena - perhaps drawing on common-sense knowledge, personal experience and adapting existing concepts from the literature. Concepts can be developed as 'sensitizing concepts' and not 'definitive concepts' (prescriptions of what to see) (cited in Blumer, 1954).

Having acquired some concrete and analytic categories for organizing the data, the next task is to begin to work on those which seem likely to be central to one's analysis, with a view to clarify their meaning and exploring their relations with other categories. One strategy here is what Glaser and Strauss (1967) call the 'constant comparative method', exampining each item of data coded in terms of a particular category to note its similarities with and differences to other data that have been similarly categorized > leading to several more clearly defined categories, as well as the specification of sub-categories. There might be a considerable amount of reassignment of data among the categories.

'Only rarely are sociological models sufficiently well developed for hyphotheses to be derived and tested > requiring considerable further development of the theory or explanation as a precondition, and in particular specification of what would be appropriate indicators for its concepts'. P.213-214
Mine is not a theory in this way, but it tests in some way the merging of theories - 'theoretical triangulation'
In Macknight's study this was the testing of the range/usefullness of spatial analytical dimentions, as in the example of the braiding river.
"when one set of theories does not exhaust the potentialities of the data, other sets can be employed to point to and explain the facts which remain unexplained ... yielding different orders of data and each perhaps being limited by the special perspectives and dimentions on which it is predicated" (Bensman and Vidich, 1960:165-6)

Typologies:
The sorts of relationships among categories that ethnographers look out for and once having produced typologies these develop questions like why particular strategies (in the typology) are adopted by particular sorts of people in particular circumstances.p.215
Systematic development - Lofland (1970:42-3) complained that much ethnographic research suffer from 'analytic interruptus' - failing to reach the initially implied climax. Investigators must take the time and trouble to:
1. to assemble self-consciously all his materials on how a (problem) is dealt with by the persons under study
2. to tease out the variations among his assembled range of instances of strategies
3. to classify them into an articulate set of... types of strategies; and
4. to present them to the reader in some orderly and preferably named and numbered manner.
Or to go even further Lazarsfeld and Barton (1951) recommends a systematic development of typologies:
By specifying the dimensions underlying the discriminations the initial categories makes when differentiating a particular range of phenomena > forcing clarificaiton and identification of other dimensions/categories.
i.e. dynamics of information control
- categories/range might then be developed within a table: extending the analytic value of the typology as far as is useful. p.217
* When hoping to study/compare the Bærum school as a case I wanted to place them along such a range - 'testing'. **since I am not doing this, but rather triangulating theories about the research object that is emerging, I will actually do better at discriminating between the types of strategies I observe - i.e. metadata adaption - and the politics of separation and care (work - division of labor).**

Concepts and indicators:
"As the categories of the analysis are being clarified and developed in relation to one another, so also must the links between concepts and indicators be specified and refined. Sensitizing concepts must be turned into something more like definitive concepts... In moving between data and concepts we must take great care to note plausible alternative links to those made in the emerging analysis, and these need to be tested."p.220
Issues that must be borne in mind when examining concept-indicator links and attending to alternative interpretations correspond to the dimensions related to sampling within cases. *lacking research*

Time/temporal context:
'The temporal context of actions includes not only the host of events that occur before and after them but also the temporal framework in terms of which the people involved locate them' > example of the construction and reconstruction of conceptions of the dying trajectories of patients at hospitals - not restricted to staff but families may not welcome signs of improvement because its seen as part of a painful and lingering death p.225
* My negation of Barbro's sheet was at odds with the temporal construction in which I could tell who was present, and who dissociated themselves from the practice. Rarely does however teachers remember to check the register.
The lives of those who are being studied are also being structured by temporal cycles. At the 10th grade the expectations might have grown with the lives of the students in the senior year.

##Chapter 3: Into the Educational ‘Field’: Relationships, Reciprocities and Responsibilities

###Making Ethnographic Fields

"Whilst seeking to hang on to empirical research practice, some scholars have sought to
rethink the field, suggesting that an ethnography of a single site could never really capture
the multiple and multi-stranded networks that shape the contemporary moment. Gupta and
Ferguson's work (1997) has been particularly helpful. They questioned what they called the
‘spatial metaphysics’ (Malkki 1989) of the British fieldwork tradition and its fetishisation of the
‘local’. Instead they called for a more pluralistic approach to writing about the multiple and
multi-stranded networks of contemporary social life. Their work called not for the
abandonment of fieldwork, but rather for its reconstruction, as ‘one element in a multistranded
methodology’, a shift from ‘bounded fields’ to ‘shifting locations’ (Gupta and
Ferguson 1997, 37). This to what Gupta and Ferguson call ‘location-work’ echoes debates
within feminism around the importance of ‘situated knowledges’ (Haraway 1988). The cultural
studies ethnographer Paul Willis made similar points, warning that the ethnographic field ‘still
carries with it a whole set of imperial baggage and social relationships as well as the notion
that you can describe a whole world’ (1996, 186). More recently still, attention has turned to the involvement of ethnographers in creating these fields. As Raymond Madden neatly frames it, ‘ethnographers are place makers …
ethnography turns someone's everyday place into another very particular sort of place’
(Madden 2010, 38). Whilst you may not agree that ‘ethnographic fields do not exist beyond
the imaginings of the ethnographer’ (Madden 2010, 38), there is no doubt that ‘fieldwork’ now
becomes as much a state of mind as a set of research practices. Echoing Madden's argument, Cook et al. (2009) go one further, and suggest that we ought
instead to think of our ethnographic research as ‘unsited’ – proposing that ‘in exchange for acknowledging that fields are always constructed out of a too-rich reality, we would gain the
freedom to determine their boundaries explicitly, in relation to our research questions’ (Cook et
al. 2009). Another solution may be to discard the agricultural imagery altogether, and to talk
instead about sites or zones of engagement. The terms change, but the commitment to ‘being
at risk’ remains. Shielded by disciplinary boundaries and a realist commitment to empirical research,
educational ethnographers have focused less on these epistemological debates. Their
research sites have often seemed practical and self-evident: the classroom, the curriculum,
the playground and the staffroom. Their focus has been the pragmatic aspects of research:
how best to define one's case, to negotiate access and to conduct interviews (Walford et al.
2008)."p.4-5

###Ethnography on the Move
"In a world of global ‘always-on’ connectivity, ideas, imageries, policies, symbols and meanings
circulate increasingly fast. It may be very difficult to keep the ethnographic ‘object’ still for long
enough to study and make sense of it. Perhaps you are interested in studying... the way transnational organisations
such as the OECD promote a tool such as PISA for promoting educational standards within national education systems. In each case, the field becomes increasingly amorphous. Yet we
also argue that ethnographers create understandings through nurturing social relationships, a
process that takes time for trust to develop. Can one be an ethnographer on the move? Does
the networked society present ethnography with an impossible contradiction?... If educational policies and practices travel transnationally, aided and abetted by governments and non-governmental agencies, can schools ever now be understood or explored as self-contained bounded entities?"

*I approached ethnographic research with the attitude that these kinds of methodological approaches would be able to help because of its empirical qualities. However, I did not at first bother to read up on the practical aspects of the work and by the time I entered the field I had very little idea at all of how an ethnographic study should be properly conducted. My background was in political science, international relations and political economy and having specialized in STS at a master-level course I felt like I had a good grasp of the theory. It felt easier to grapple with practicalities as they appeared than to begin to take apart a wide and undetermined literature. I was quite aware that this implied learning the 'hard way', but I the confusion of dealing with the heavy traditional load of a field concerned with descriptive naturalism as I was struggling with the ontological questions of the post-human perspective perhaps felt too great.

Luckily these concerns where not that well-founded. They were indeed questions that have required much pondering, but they were concerns that had been voiced throughout the later parts of the history of the field, and especially at late. Moreover, it drew from the same authors as I. Mills and .. [-@mills_ethnography_2013] describes these well. The presuppositions that shape the genre of participation and the focus of observation became acute as I approached decisions of what I could reasonably (and ethically) research, and how to divide up my precious research time.

Perhaps it was good that I did not want to let myself spend too much time lingering around how to adapt my research, and (as I feared) implicitly my research question, to the local. Perhaps was I to influenced by my ideas of my former workplace as a locality*

In their Globalizing the Research Imagination (Kenway and Fahey 2009) two educationalists interview ethnographers from anthropology, sociology and geography whose work has set out to redefine the research imaginary and the
way research is taught. Whilst not all the contributors are ethnographers, all are profoundly
aware of the demands placed on students to develop a conceptual tool-kit that allows them to
think across boundaries and borders. As Fazal Rizvi puts it:
*It is impossible to look at a place or a culture without seeing it as interrelated to other
places and cultures, to history and to the cultural politics of interdisciplinarity … And
that really is the shift I would like to see in students, away from a static, positivist
bounded view of places and cultures, to a perspective that is defined in terms of their
relationship and connections to the rest of the world. (2009, 113)* p.6

This methodological vision of the ‘multisited ethnography’ resonated with the growing emphasis among experimental
ethnographers such as Bruno Latour on understanding and following the networks and
connections that shaped the social. The ‘field’ was no longer simply a geographical place but
became rather a conceptual space that allowed abstract connections and rewarded close
theorisation. Ethnography increasingly began to be understood as something intersubjective,
co-constructed and mediated. p.6

Anthropologists of education are increasingly exploring educational connections across time
and space. Stambach's Faith in Schools (2010) follows American evangelicals from US
universities to Tanzanian and Ugandan schools. her larger aim is to look at education as a ‘pivotal site in which
multiple and crosscutting ‘schools of faith’ inform and transform the state’ (ibid., 7). It is an
ethnographic analysis that has serious theoretical ambitions. p.7


###Ethnography as Reciprocity?

If ethnographic relationships are always also social relationships, then there can be no easy
how-to formula to guide one through the tangled thicket of social life... Becoming best
buddies with just those people who seek to befriend is never a wise tactic in life, nor should it
be in social research...Yet whilst full-blown moral
relativism is ethically indefensible, there is a space for a degree of ‘methodological relativism’
(Mills 2003) in ethnographic research, and for not immediately jumping to conclusions or
positions. p.8
*I have to consider whether I spent too much time with the team and did not spend enough energy finding other positions regarding moral dillemas that revealed themselves as issue in the teamroom.*
acknowledge his mediating role, helping people make sense of the situations
they find themselves in, and providing them with a comparative perspective on education... I did often feel part of an interpretative community of young people interested in
social and political change. Many of my informants said that they valued our
discussions as opportunities to vent frustration and reflect on their socio-political
position. It also became clear that for many students I was a resource p.9
*It was hard for me to engage in a comparative discussion of education at the team-room. Sometimes I was a vent for those wanting to discuss the information infrastructure. It was hard making connections between larger trends (i.e. price of software) and the situation we took part in, but I could discuss the changes since we used the MLG system.*

###Ethnographic Ethics, Ethnographic Politics
*Being able to deal with the issues of the organization as a whole requires me to develop sophisticated methods; like 'creative techniques to anonymise her informants' and 'borrowed techniques from journalism, such as always getting two people's accounts of any event in order to corroborate individual narratives. She was assiduous at taking notes at public meetings within the university, pointedly tapping loudly on her laptop to draw attention to
herself, but also at attending closely to the way the university portrayed itself, in news media,
in internal emails and newsletters'*
