#This is a note to myself.

Talking about the need to understand learning as a fundamentally different process, or ask questions about the fundamental of the process - not to assume the standards of previous research.

The idea of learning has to be understood closer to the systems that organize the materiality of the classroom and the school. The students are always self organizing. They are individuals and learning is a broad conception of how they broaden their role as participants and agents.

The experimental system is the system that teacher and students build together. This system standardizes in ways similar to the way the printing press once standardized spelling. It creates third party systematizers. This is the industrialization of education. The third party is essential. The idea of using each other as reference for the same rules, as well as members of the group of students is part of every classroom situation and evaluation. The ambition is a common frame of reference, as to what is required of a good student.

I need to show that the teacher's memory work is selective. It does not need to map the entirety of the process. Only that the school system and its slow process towards digitazation (its role in an important war of information) is a result of the negotiations.


The more variation the more conflict. System in place to create standard flexibility (discretion vs rigidity). Teachers relate to the system's translated expectations of organization and work practice.
-'System-level bureaucracy' (electronic self-help solutions) and interaction as service-tailoring (mediated through computer programs) are interlinked in the presumed 'outsourced' nature of such solutions.

Thinking of the (smart) class-room as a new bureaucratic space, in-line with street-level and screen-level bureaucracy requires us to apply the idea of the bureaucrat to a distributed network in a mediated space.

The classroom is never one space, but it has been used to abstract the witness account as a referential materiality of learning. The communal aspect is ever present.

The book structures the presence of each individual and the commune, which is demonstrated by its use by the teacher on the smart-board and on the PC.

However, the question of ownership arise when one starts to treat each PC as its own personal learning environment. Who writes what where is crucial is one wants to exemplify learning through the processual.

Could one ask whether teachers switching back to non-digital systems is a negotiation with the systems that was expected to be in place - the requirement to tweak and to industrialize - unlike in scale, but like in nature?

(The switch board is an example of how the board is used to create logic that is repeated elsewhere)

When less requirements are put on the use of books the transformative effect of creativity is given more weight. Teachers work hard to balance imagination and discipline for the GROUP (in Norway) to better embody their imaginative ideas > Lisa depended on the group knowing the routine to sustain momentum - blackboard's free movement.
The ideal of creative noise as opposed to creative discipline is telling for their hybrid ambitions.
The active use of Kahoot as a group activity is also telling of the functionality of creative noise.
